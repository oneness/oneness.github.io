<p>
If you are just curious about the ETC principle to ground all other
principles of software engineering, you can scroll all the way down of
this post to find out what I meant by ETC. If you know what ETC stands
for and are already grounding your engineering efforts, you can just
skip this post and go on with your MIT (most important task). However,
If you are skeptical, which you always should be, you might want to
read on to learn why.
</p>

<p>
As an Engineer, our primary function on daily basis is to come up
with a working solution to a specific problem that arose out of
need from our <b>users</b>. I highlight the word user here since the user
could be our end user, could be our fellow engineers, or could just be
ourselves. If you have been in the industry for a while, you might
have been exposed to plethora of must follow principles and practices
from existing literature, which I categorize as `transmittable`
knowledge. Apart from that, there is another type of knowledge that I
would like to classify as `untransmittable` where you have to
experience it to make it your own. Those two types of knowledge
corresponds to how we learn new things: 1. We read transmittable
knowledge from various sources 2. We bring them into our practice to
form our deep understanding of it. Only then, we are able to utilize
our newly learned knowledge effectively to achieve our end result,
which is by the way to meet the needs of our fellow <b>users</b> as apposed
to the need of certain systems. Now, let us stack ETC principle
against three of the most well known engineering paradigms so we are
always grounded in our approach to utilizing them.

<h2 id="org7665c2a">Monolith vs Microservice</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org7665c2a">
<p>
We have come a long way since the 1950s in our approach to different
design and architectural paradigms. Over the last 10 years or so, we
all have been preached to about how great Microservice is and have drunk its
Kool-Aid. It has penetrated engineering organizations to such a degree
that it has become our new hammer. Now all of a sudden, we start
waking up to its trade offs and even going back to old monolith
architecture. What happened? We just did not ground ourselves when
we made a decision to adopt microservice style. The question we should
have asked ourselves before committing to microservice or monolith is:
How it enables us to make whatever we are doing easy to change? Does
monolith style make our system easy to change? Maybe. Does
microservice approach enables us easy to change our system? Maybe. So
the definite answer to both questions is "it depends". So what should
be the basis of our decision to go with one way or the other? Maybe
an example in order to drive my point here. Let's say you're
designing an e-commerce system. It has catalog, checkout and shipping
components. Does putting all of the components into one service make
the system easy to change for you? May be it will if you are the only
person or your team are the only team working on it. Does putting all
of the components into separate services make the system easy to
change? May be it will if you have three separate teams working on
them.

<h2 id="orgcf7d58f">Top down vs bottom up design</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgcf7d58f">
<p>
I have seen teams swear by one way or the other on this matter. From
time to time, someone comes along to preach one over the other
declaring the other approach is dead or should just be avoided. Every
time when I face such a design issue, I always ask myself this
question over and over again: Does top down or bottom up design
enables me or my team to respond to change? Most of the time, I end up
choosing both approaches because it helps me to focus on making the
system easier to change. I tend to use following rule of thumb. When I
have clear mental model, I use the bottom up approach so I can create
layers of abstractions to compose better, which in turn enables me to
make changes easier. When I have a high level of domain clarity, I
tend to start with top down design because it helps me to focus on not
that clear pieces in isolation, which in turn makes changes a lot more
manageable.

<div id="outline-container-org7672d35" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org7672d35">OO vs FP paradigm</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org7672d35">
<p>
I was preached and have been preaching OO style of programming
paradigm from since my college days and well into the early years of my
profession. Then FP became the new style (old became new?) and all OO
programming languages started to add more FP style constructs. Now we
see debates over why FP is superior over OO and should be used over
all cost claiming that OO is responsible for all the mess that we
created over the last 20 years or so. Now, I came to realize that it
is not this or that paradigm that is responsible for all the issues we
created. Rather, it is the blind adoption of them by us as
practitioners. Let us think about a minute what OO have given us when
we started to adopt it: The ability to structure, reuse and share code
across systems. Essentially, we were able to build/change information
systems faster and easier than ever before. However, it did not hold
up well against ETC principle with its humongous frameworks and so
called best practices. Now, FP is in its renaissance and being
preached as the savior at the cost of relegating OO to its
oblivion. OO is a great tool set in our arsenal for certain types of
problem domain and SmallTalk is an example of how it should be
practiced. FP is another excellent way of approaching to engineering
problem in that it encourages to treat systems as referential data
transformation pipeline. Does it inherently make the system easy to
change? Not really. We are quite capable of making a spaghetti mess
out of FP as much as we have done with OO. See a pattern here? ETC
principle grounds your choice of paradigm into its proper place: Is
x helping you to make changes easier? If not, then x most likely not
best route for you.
</p>

<p>
I can go on and on with arguing ETC be the test to pass for all of the
paradigms and even development approaches such as TDD, BDD and
DDD. For example, If your code is easy to change, it will most likely
be easy to test, maps most likely well with your domain and most
likely models use cases better. You can adopt any approach or
principles such as SOLID principle if you consistently ask yourself:
Does this really helps me to make changes easier? If it passes this
test, adopt it, if not avoid it.
</p>

<p>
It is not my intention to make you dogmatic about <b>Easy To Change</b>
(ETC) principle but rather to convince yourself to have one principle
to ground all other aspects of your engineering endeavors. Happy
engineering and never forget to have and share fun coding!
