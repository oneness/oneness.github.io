<p>
This year's Strange Loop was my 4th and it was as good as it has been
in the past. One of the main reason I like to go to conferences
especially Strange Loop was to see beyond the state of the art
transmittable knowledge, which is the untransimittable one. In this
age of Google search, Stack Overflow copy/paste and Coding school
driven programming, which has its own place in our industry, we need
to be cognizant of the existence and importance of the
untransimittable part of software engineering knowledge that can only
be acquired by learning from the masters. And Strange Loop has never
failed me so far to provide an opportunity to jolt my brain to find
easier those tacit knowledge that otherwise might have taken me long
winding road to acquire. I would like to present few of those that I
have taken notes so it will help my aspiring fellow engineers.
</p>

<p>
<b>Domain Driven Design</b> : There are numerous books/posts/videos about
 how to do it right and I have been using it with success for the last
 few years. However, I have always been little bit unclear about how I
 measure its benefit within my engineering team. I got the `AHA`
 moment when second day keynote put up a quote on its slide stating
 that 'Small change in product (Domain), should result in small change
 in the code (implementation)'. Now, I know how to measure if we are
 doing it right or wrong in my team.
</p>

<p>
<b>API Design</b> : There is a talk about using Rust's type system in
 aiding you to design a robust API that does validation and error
 reporting right. While that talk focus on how Rust type system is
 tremendously useful to library (API) designer, what I see from that
 talk is way beyond just helpfulness of a well designed type system,
 which is a languages ability to allow you to specify your system's
 interfaces exactly as you intended. If you are not using one of those
 languages (Rust, F#, Ada and Clojure &#x2026; any language that allows you
 specify interfaces) in your library/API work, you should be checking
 them out to see what you are missing (also remember to keep an eye
 for what you are loosing. It is all about trade offs).
</p>

<p>
<b>Dependencies</b> : This is a topic that is very dear to day to day
 practice considering my current preferred tool of choice (Clojure and
 ClojureScript). The branchstack talk triggered sort of `AHA` moment
 for me in treating the entire state of your system (code) vs the
 state of your outside dependencies. I'd like to think of them as your
 internal state vs external state. I have been advocating and
 practicing a sort of convention your system should only be just three steps
 away from being able to be worked upon, which is:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-shell">git clone &lt;your_system_x&gt; &amp;&amp; make deps &amp;&amp; make run
</pre>
</div>
<p>
Note that it does not have to be git and make. Any tool of your
choice will do. The idea is that as a project owner, it is your
responsibility to make sure that your system workflow is easily
reproducible and those tools should be treated as first class citizen
as your system logic code.
</p>

<p>
Again, those kind of tacit knowledge can only be learned by being in
the presence of crafts people and having actually conversation with
them in close vicinity. I have enjoyed all the talks that I attended
and even more so the hallway and lunch table conversation. And I am
looking forward to Strange Loop 2022 already :).

One of the feature of Eshell that took me sometime to really
appreciate is its built-in ability to emulate Plan9 smart Shell. It
allows you to run a script or a command, run it again by just hitting
enter key after you modify it, say you made a mistake or want to
change part of it using Emacs editing power. You might say that you
can do same thing in any terminal using your up arrow key and command
line editing. But I challenge you to try it until you fully realize
the advantage you have vs regular terminal. Below is a simple screen
recording to show you what I mean:

I recommend you read following post to learn more about smart shell
and more about eshell including aliases:

happy Eshelling!

Since eshell buffer is just a regular emacs buffer, we have all of the
emacs power at our disposal. In part 3 of my post, I briefly alluded
to multiple terminal management by just using few lines of elisp and
all without using any third party packages. I am posting the main elisp
function for posterity here:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(defun krun (cmd)
  (interactive
   (list
    (ido-completing-read
     "Enter cmd to run (append ##name for buffer name): "
     (let ((history nil))
       ;; We have to build up a list ourselves from the ring vector.
       (dotimes (index (ring-length keshell-history-global-ring))
	 (push (ring-ref keshell-history-global-ring index) history))
       ;; Show them most-recent-first.
       (setq history (nreverse history))))))
  (let* ((cmds (split-string cmd "##"))
	 (tag (or (-&gt; cmds second)
		  "kshell"))
	 (buff-name (-&gt; tag s-chomp s-trim)))
    (kshell cmd buff-name)))
</pre>
</div>
<p>
The above function (along with those from the previous post) will
allow you to do following:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Start a new shell with a specific name by just appending
##buffer-name after the command</li>
<li>Run a command from history or new command in a dedicated eshell
buffer, which defaults to <b>kshell</b>. You can override as any name you
want.</li>
<li>Use all hotkeys, interactive lisp functions as you would for regular
emacs buffer. For example, you can do buffer switching, ibuffer
management, isearch, protect a buffer from being killed, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Following demonstrates above cases I am talking about:

If you have been following my `Why Eshell` series, you might be
wondering about interactive ido completion for eshell. Since Eshell
buffer is just a regular emacs buffer, we can compose few emacs
builtin functionalities to bend it to our command line work flow.
Following is all the code you need. Note that it is heavily commented
so you can understand what is happening.
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(defun kshell-with-name (&amp;optional name)
  ;; creates an eshell buffer with `kshell' as the default name. Take
  ;; optional name to override
  (let ((m (-&gt;&gt; (or name "kshell")
		(format "*%s*"))))
    (if (get-buffer m)
	(pop-to-buffer m)
      (progn
	(eshell)
	(rename-buffer m)))))

(defun kshell (&amp;optional cmd buff-name send-input)
  ;; interactive fn that you can call via M-x or hotkey. It detects
  ;; current project root to start eshell buffer if no `buff-name' is
  ;; given. You can control how the `cmd` gets insert only or insert
  ;; and executed using `send-input` flag. Ex. Useful for further
  ;; editing.
  (interactive)
  (let ((dir (projectile-project-root))) ;; you need projectile
    (if buff-name
	(kshell-with-name buff-name)
      (kshell-with-name))
    (eshell/clear-scrollback)
    (insert (format "cd %s" (or dir "~/")))
    (eshell-send-input)
    (insert (format "%s" cmd))
    (when send-input (eshell-send-input))))

(defun krun (cmd)
  ;; eshell command history with ido completion. Assign it to a hot
  ;; key say, F12 and you will get a search-able command history that
  ;; you can execute just by doing ido interactive search.
  (interactive
   (list
    (ido-completing-read
     "Enter cmd to run (append ##name for buffer name): "
     (let ((history nil))
       ;; We have to build up a list ourselves from the ring vector.
       (dotimes (index (ring-length keshell-history-global-ring))
	 (push (ring-ref keshell-history-global-ring index) history))
       ;; Show them most-recent-first.
       (setq history (nreverse history))))))
  (let* ((cmds (split-string cmd "##")) ;; you need s.el lib
	 (tag (or (-&gt; cmds second)
		  "kshell"))
	 (buff-name (-&gt; tag s-chomp s-trim)))
    (kshell cmd buff-name)))
</pre>
</div>
<p>
Here is the screen recording in action:

<p>
I am using F12 to invoke `krun` and my cross session eshell history
shows up in the minibuffer where I can use ido completion to select a
command that I can run. As an added benefit, above code allows one to
bring a eshell buffer with specific name by adding ##name at the end
of the command if one wants to have the command run in a dedicated
buffer.

<p>
Among many reasons of why I use eshell as my main terminal, I listed
following in part 1 of my `Why Eshell?` series blog post. I am listing
it here for posterity:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><b>Long running command notification and time</b></li>
<li><b>Cross session history</b></li>
<li><b>Interactive ido completion</b></li>
<li><b>Unified interface (shell prompt buffer as regular emacs buffer)</b></li>
<li><b>Plan9 Style Shell prompt (Think of it as bash REPL)</b></li>
<li><b>Multiple terminal management</b></li>
<li><b>Super charge bash with elisp</b></li>
<li><b>Eshell aliases that puts bash aliases to shame :)</b></li>
</ol>
<p>
I addressed first point here: <a href="https://www.birkey.co/2021-06-20-why-eshell-part-1.html">notification and time</a>. Let me address
second point, which is sharing eshell history across many terminal
sessions.
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-elisp">(defvar keshell-history-global-ring nil
  "The history ring shared across Eshell sessions.")

(defun keshell-hist-use-global-history ()
  "Make Eshell history shared across different sessions."
  (unless keshell-history-global-ring
    (when eshell-history-file-name
      (eshell-read-history nil t))
    (setq keshell-history-global-ring
	  (or eshell-history-ring (make-ring eshell-history-size))))
  (setq eshell-history-ring keshell-history-global-ring))
;; Following hook enables it
(add-hook 'eshell-mode-hook 'keshell-hist-use-global-history)
;; Following removes the hook
(remove-hook 'eshell-mode-hook 'keshell-hist-use-global-history)
</pre>
</div>
<p>
After evaluating above 12 lines of elisp, you will have a list that
holds all the eshell entries across sessions, which you can persist
into a history file (just uses bash history file) and can even share
it across machines over network. This opens up a whole new
possibilities of completions, deduplication and multiple eshell
buffer management goodness, which I will cover in the next few parts
of `Why Eshell?` posts. So stay tuned and happy eshelling!
