<p>
From time to time, I got asked why I use eshell as my main terminal.
There are multiple reasons I do so and covering all of them in one
post would be too long. Instead, I would like to start with a high
level bullet points and address each one in a separate blog post with
working code examples where I can point my coworkers and friends to
them so they can pick and choose as they wish.
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><b>Long running command notification and time</b></li>
<li><b>Cross session history</b></li>
<li><b>Interactive ido completion</b></li>
<li><b>Unified interface (shell prompt buffer as regular emacs buffer)</b></li>
<li><b>Plan9 Style Shell prompt (Think of it as bash REPL)</b></li>
<li><b>Multiple terminal management</b></li>
<li><b>Super charge bash with elisp</b></li>
<li><b>Eshell aliases that puts bash aliases to shame :)</b></li>
</ol>
<p>
Let us start with how you can accomplish the first item from the list
above. Following 18 lines of elisp will give you the super power of:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>How long a command took to run as if you typed in <b>time &lt;command&gt;</b></li>
<li>Notify you that the long running command finished in x second even
if you switch away from Emacs saving you the trouble of constantly
checking back. As a bonus, you can set the notification threshold
for long running commands that you want to run async.</li>
</ul>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-elisp">;; eshell time and notification
(defvar-local eshell-current-command-start-time nil)

(defun eshell-current-command-start ()
  (setq eshell-current-command-start-time (current-time)))

(defun eshell-current-command-stop ()
  (when eshell-current-command-start-time
    (let ((elapsed-time (float-time
			 (time-subtract (current-time)
					eshell-current-command-start-time))))
      (if (&gt; elapsed-time 30)
	  (tooltip-show (format "Finished in: %.0fs" elapsed-time))
	(eshell-interactive-print
	 (format "Time: %.0fs\n" elapsed-time))))
    (setq eshell-current-command-start-time nil)))

(defun eshell-current-command-time-track ()
  (add-hook 'eshell-pre-command-hook #'eshell-current-command-start nil t)
  (add-hook 'eshell-post-command-hook #'eshell-current-command-stop nil t))

;; This line below installs time tracking and notification
(add-hook 'eshell-mode-hook #'eshell-current-command-time-track)
;; Once you eval above snippet in emacs, fire up M-x eshell, and type:
sleep 40
;; You can switch away from emacs and will be notified that above
;; command took 40s to run
;; To uninstall
;; (remove-hook 'eshell-mode-hook #'eshell-current-command-time-track)
</pre>
</div>
<p>
Try doing above with some bashrc voodoo or plug-in that you have no
control over. I have been there and done that and it is one of many
reasons why I use eshell now. I hope someone finds it useful to his or
her command line work flow. Happy eshelling!

<div class="post-date">13 Jun 2021</div><h1 class="post-title"><a href="https://www.birkey.co/2021-06-13-let-and-binding-macros-in-clojure.html">Let and Binding macros in Clojure</a></h1>
<p>
Clojure has number special forms. Among them are <b>let</b> and
<b>binding</b> that are implemented as macros. For new comers to Clojure,
above can be confusing to understand, which I hope to address in this
blog post. If you have read "Programming Clojure" book, you might be
thinking that it is easy to use them correctly considering following
straightforward example:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-clojure">(def x 7) ;; bind the var x to the value 7
(defn print-x [x]
  (println x))

(let [x 9]
  (print-x)) ;; prints 7

(binding [x 9]
  (print-x)) ;; prints 9
</pre>
</div>
<p>
Why? Because <b>let</b> creates a lexical scoped vars, which is local to
the code block or functions where it is initially defined while <b>def</b>
creates a global var that is visible to all functions under the
namespace that you are in. Therefore, in the example above, <b>let</b> just
created a new "x" with the value of 9. But it is not local to the
function "print-x". That is to say, "print-x" have no knowledge of the
local scoped binding that is created by <b>let</b>. <b>binding</b> macro instead
creates a new binding for the already existed var, "x" with the value
of 9. Since "print-x" is evaluated within the <b>binding</b> form, the
newly bound value is visible to any chained calls within the form. All
nice and easy. However, it is not that obvious to understand and use
them correctly. Look at following example:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-clojure">(def x 7)
(def y 9)

(let [x 5 y x] y) ;; returns 5
(binding [x 5 y x] y) ;; returns 7
</pre>
</div>
<p>
<b>let</b> example is just fine. It created a new var "y" with the value of
5 bound to it. But what is going on with the <b>binding</b> example? If we
dig little deeper to Clojure API doc, we learn that the new bindings
in <b>binding</b> are made in parallel, not sequential as it is in <b>let</b>.
Therefore, existing var "y" gets bound to the root binding of "x" not
the overshadowed value of "x", which is the case in the <b>let</b> example.
OK, so far so good. Let us look at another example:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-clojure">(defn print-x [&amp; args]
  (println "print-x prints: " args))
(defn print-y [&amp; args]
  (println "print-y prints: " args))
(let [print-x print-y] (print-x 123)) ;; print-y prints: (1 2 3)
(binding [print-x print-y] (print-x 123)) ;; print-y prints: (1 2 3)
(binding [print-x print-y] #(print-x 123)) ;; prints
					     ;; cryptic "#&lt;user$eval__28$fn__30
					     ;; user$eval__28$fn__30@bdb503&gt;"
((binding [print-x print-y] #(print-x 123))) ;; print-x prints: (1 2 3)
</pre>
</div>
<p>
All the lines but the last two are pretty straight forward. But how
about the last line? Shouldn't it call "print-y" function? Not really.
It is because the anonymous function is evaluated outside of the
<b>binding</b> form. The "#&lt;user$eval_<sub>28</sub>$fn_<sub>30</sub>
user$eval_<sub>28</sub>$fn_<sub>30</sub>@bdb503&gt;" is an indication that anonymous function
did not get evaluated. The extra parens evals above form. Ok,
now, how do you make sure it evaluates within the <b>binding</b> form? Just
enclose the anonymous function within parenthesis. What do we learn
from all of the above? Here are the summary that helps one use <b>let</b>
and <b>binding</b> correctly:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Use <b>binding</b> only if you are trying to alter a behavior dynamically
for special-vars that is already defined. Enclose your special vars
within * as recommended by idiomatic clojure to make your intent
clear.</li>
<li>Use <b>let</b> for locally scoped vars and avoid shadowing already
defined vars.</li>
<li>Remember <b>let</b> binding is sequential and <b>binding</b> binding is done in parallel.</li>
<li>Pay close attention to the scope of the <b>binding</b> form. Any
expression that is not evaluated inside the form, will not see the
binding. That is to say, binding in <b>binding</b> form is thread local
starting from the <b>binding</b> form until it ends including any
expression that is chained within the form, which is what the
thread-local are all about.</li>
<li>Lastly avoid using <b>binding</b> as much as possible. I have seen many
production bugs related to issues I outlined here.</li>

<p>
I am pretty excited to learn that Strange Loop is happening this
year! It is one of the few technical conference that I always
recommend to my fellow teammates. What is more exciting are the
sessions including few keynotes. What this has to do with the
topic of the blog post, which is on programming style, you say? If you
squint at the sessions, the author of <b>Exercises in Programming Style</b>
is the first keynote speaker. It is one of the best book on programming I
have ever read in recent years. I am not going to spoil it here with
summary or gist but I'd like share few take home points I really liked
about the book.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Having a clear, well understood programming problem throughout the
book: given a text file, we want to display the N (e.g. 25) most
frequent words and corresponding frequencies ordered by decreasing
value of frequency. Once the understanding what problem we are
dealing with out of the way, the remaining is just choosing a style
to solve it, which the book does fantastic job to explain. It even
has full source code in the book.</li>
<li>Concise and clear way of making the reader understand many programming
techniques that one might otherwise gets really confused. For
example, Monads, CPS (continuation passing style), FRP and many
others.</li>
<li>Have you ever wondered how neural networks (NN) works? Second
edition have you covered with clear explanation and code as she has
done with many concepts from the first edition.</li>
</ul>

<p>
I strongly recommend the book to both novice or pros alike. It is a
book that you rarely see in terms of style and clarity with full
working code. We really need this kind of books more to have
programming accessible and understood by more people. I do believe it
is a classic. If you are planning to attend Strange Loop, remember to
say hello and thank her for it.

<p>
As an Emacs user, your muscle memories constantly remind you of
certain behavior of it when you had to use other Unix tools. I was
recently viewing a large file using <b>less</b> and searched for
<b>ErrorCode</b> by just typing <b>errorcode</b> and surprised to find that it
did not find any match. Then, I searched by typing <b>ErrorCode</b> and it
did find a match containing the word, which reminded me of the fact
that <b>less</b> by default is case sensitive. I then set out to find if I
can tell <b>less</b> to ignore case by reading man pages. I am pleasantly
surprised to read following:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-bash">-i or --ignore-case
	      Causes searches to ignore case; that is, uppercase and lowercase
	      are  considered identical.  This option is ignored if any upper-
	      case letters appear in the search pattern; in other words, if  a
	      pattern  contains  uppercase  letters, then that search does not
	      ignore case.
</pre>
</div>
<p>
That is exactly how Emacs isearch behaves by default. I added
following alias to my bash config to make above the default for less.
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-bash">alias less='less -i'
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Once again, less is <b>literally</b> more and you could do more using less.

<p>
A web application tinkerer deals with malformed inputs, faulty
networks, buggy software and everything in between. One tool that
saved the day on more than one occasion is: <b>cURL</b>, which should be
under every engineers' arsenal. Following are two examples how it
proved to be just the right tool to reach for.
</p>

<p>
Among many micro services writtent in Clojure, one of them exposed
following logic via a REST API:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Take a shortened URL, expand it to find the actual
URL it is pointing to, and parse URL param to generate a JSON object
of k/v to return to the caller.</li>
</ul>

<p>
One of our client reported a bug where their Ad data dashboard did not
show up one day. Looking at the log trace, I realized that above
service might be failing. I had a choice of starting a full suite of
our services to reproduce it or just using cURL from the terminal to
find out what the Ad URL expanded to. Here is an example:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-bash">curl -ILs https://bit.ly/2MSn9Xm
</pre>
</div>
<p>
Following is the output:
</p>

The options <b>-ILs</b> tells cURL to query resource headers with location
information in silent mode. After seeing the location information of
the client's Ad URL, I was able to pinpoint the missing url param from
the source data that our client is expecting. Once I informed this
info to our client, they are able to fix their own issue with grace.
</p>

<p>
Second time cURL came to the rescue is when a developer from
my team reached out to me for a mysterious bug he was experiencing. An
API call was failing for 50% of the time with truncated response that
was causing error on his application. Not knowing anything about the
application much, I asked him to call the API using cURL to eliminate
the possibility of OS network related issues. Once I know that the API
work is working 100% of the time via cURL, I narrowed the issues down
to the application code. The application is written in Node and
following are abbreviated version of how the JS code looks like:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-javascript">function getFoo(){
  return axios.get(urlFoo)
}

function getBar(url){
  return axios.get(url)
}

function getFooBar(){
 var foo = getFoo(); //block until we have a result
 // this line below was failing due to malformed foo becuase it is truncated
 var url = "magicUrl" //parse `foo`, construct url
 var bar = getBar(url)
 return parse(bar)
}

</pre>
</div>
<p>
My teammate said that he did try increasing the timeout of the `axios`
library but it did not help. I asked him to see if `axios` have
some configuration setting related to buffer size or connection, and he
confirmed that it does have `connection reuse` setting where it is
default value are `false`. I asked him to try setting it to `true`,
which he did and voila, API call went through with 100% success
rate. Now, our problem is solved and we can move on with our
lives.
</p>

<p>
I just want to convince you how usefull <b>cURL</b> command is and you
should use it whenever you can. I might write a post in the future on
why the response was getting truncated and why reusing the connection
helped solve the issue.
