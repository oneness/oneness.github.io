<p>
A web application tinkerer deals with malformed inputs, faulty
networks, buggy software and everything in between. One tool that
saved the day on more than one occasion is: <b>cURL</b>, which should be
under every engineers' arsenal. Following are two examples how it
proved to be just the right tool to reach for.
</p>

<p>
Among many micro services writtent in Clojure, one of them exposed
following logic via a REST API:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Take a shortened URL, expand it to find the actual
URL it is pointing to, and parse URL param to generate a JSON object
of k/v to return to the caller.</li>
</ul>

<p>
One of our client reported a bug where their Ad data dashboard did not
show up one day. Looking at the log trace, I realized that above
service might be failing. I had a choice of starting a full suite of
our services to reproduce it or just using cURL from the terminal to
find out what the Ad URL expanded to. Here is an example:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-bash">curl -ILs https://bit.ly/2MSn9Xm
</pre>
</div>
<p>
Following is the output:
</p>
<pre class="example">

The options <b>-ILs</b> tells cURL to query resource headers with location
information in silent mode. After seeing the location information of
the client's Ad URL, I was able to pinpoint the missing url param from
the source data that our client is expecting. Once I informed this
info to our client, they are able to fix their own issue with grace.
</p>

<p>
Second time cURL came to the rescue is when a developer from
my team reached out to me for a mysterious bug he was experiencing. An
API call was failing for 50% of the time with truncated response that
was causing error on his application. Not knowing anything about the
application much, I asked him to call the API using cURL to eliminate
the possibility of OS network related issues. Once I know that the API
work is working 100% of the time via cURL, I narrowed the issues down
to the application code. The application is written in Node and
following are abbreviated version of how the JS code looks like:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-javascript">function getFoo(){
  return axios.get(urlFoo)
}

function getBar(url){
  return axios.get(url)
}

function getFooBar(){
 var foo = getFoo(); //block until we have a result
 // this line below was failing due to malformed foo becuase it is truncated
 var url = "magicUrl" //parse `foo`, construct url
 var bar = getBar(url)
 return parse(bar)
}

</pre>
</div>
<p>
My teammate said that he did try increasing the timeout of the `axios`
library but it did not help. I asked him to see if `axios` have
some configuration setting related to buffer size or connection, and he
confirmed that it does have `connection reuse` setting where it is
default value are `false`. I asked him to try setting it to `true`,
which he did and voila, API call went through with 100% success
rate. Now, our problem is solved and we can move on with our
lives.
</p>

<p>
I just want to convince you how usefull <b>cURL</b> command is and you
should use it whenever you can. I might write a post in the future on
why the response was getting truncated and why reusing the connection
helped solve the issue.

<div class="post-date">26 Dec 2020</div><h1 class="post-title"><a href="https://www.birkey.co/2020-12-26-ETC-principle-to-ground-all.html">ETC - The principle to guide engineering</a></h1>
<p>
If you are just curious about the ETC principle to ground all other
principles of software engineering, you can scroll all the way down of
this post to find out what I meant by ETC. If you know what ETC stands
for and are already grounding your engineering efforts, you can just
skip this post and go on with your MIT (most important task). However,
If you are skeptical, which you always should be, you might want to
read on to learn why.
</p>

<p>
As an Engineer, our primary function on daily basis is to come up
with a working solution to a specific problem that arose out of
need from our <b>users</b>. I highlight the word user here since the user
could be our end user, could be our fellow engineers, or could just be
ourselves. If you have been in the industry for a while, you might
have been exposed to plethora of must follow principles and practices
from existing literature, which I categorize as `transmittable`
knowledge. Apart from that, there is another type of knowledge that I
would like to classify as `untransmittable` where you have to
experience it to make it your own. Those two types of knowledge
corresponds to how we learn new things: 1. We read transmittable
knowledge from various sources 2. We bring them into our practice to
form our deep understanding of it. Only then, we are able to utilize
our newly learned knowledge effectively to achieve our end result,
which is by the way to meet the needs of our fellow <b>users</b> as apposed
to the need of certain systems. Now, let us stack ETC principle
against three of the most well known engineering paradigms so we are
always grounded in our approach to utilizing them.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org7665c2a" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org7665c2a">Monolith vs Microservice</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org7665c2a">
<p>
We have come a long way since the 1950s in our approach to different
design and architectural paradigms. Over the last 10 years or so, we
all have been preached to about how great Microservice is and have drunk its
Kool-Aid. It has penetrated engineering organizations to such a degree
that it has become our new hammer. Now all of a sudden, we start
waking up to its trade offs and even going back to old monolith
architecture. What happened? We just did not ground ourselves when
we made a decision to adopt microservice style. The question we should
have asked ourselves before committing to microservice or monolith is:
How it enables us to make whatever we are doing easy to change? Does
monolith style make our system easy to change? Maybe. Does
microservice approach enables us easy to change our system? Maybe. So
the definite answer to both questions is "it depends". So what should
be the basis of our decision to go with one way or the other? Maybe
an example in order to drive my point here. Let's say you're
designing an e-commerce system. It has catalog, checkout and shipping
components. Does putting all of the components into one service make
the system easy to change for you? May be it will if you are the only
person or your team are the only team working on it. Does putting all
of the components into separate services make the system easy to
change? May be it will if you have three separate teams working on
them.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgcf7d58f" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgcf7d58f">Top down vs bottom up design</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgcf7d58f">
<p>
I have seen teams swear by one way or the other on this matter. From
time to time, someone comes along to preach one over the other
declaring the other approach is dead or should just be avoided. Every
time when I face such a design issue, I always ask myself this
question over and over again: Does top down or bottom up design
enables me or my team to respond to change? Most of the time, I end up
choosing both approaches because it helps me to focus on making the
system easier to change. I tend to use following rule of thumb. When I
have clear mental model, I use the bottom up approach so I can create
layers of abstractions to compose better, which in turn enables me to
make changes easier. When I have a high level of domain clarity, I
tend to start with top down design because it helps me to focus on not
that clear pieces in isolation, which in turn makes changes a lot more
manageable.

<div id="outline-container-org7672d35" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org7672d35">OO vs FP paradigm</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org7672d35">
<p>
I was preached and have been preaching OO style of programming
paradigm from since my college days and well into the early years of my
profession. Then FP became the new style (old became new?) and all OO
programming languages started to add more FP style constructs. Now we
see debates over why FP is superior over OO and should be used over
all cost claiming that OO is responsible for all the mess that we
created over the last 20 years or so. Now, I came to realize that it
is not this or that paradigm that is responsible for all the issues we
created. Rather, it is the blind adoption of them by us as
practitioners. Let us think about a minute what OO have given us when
we started to adopt it: The ability to structure, reuse and share code
across systems. Essentially, we were able to build/change information
systems faster and easier than ever before. However, it did not hold
up well against ETC principle with its humongous frameworks and so
called best practices. Now, FP is in its renaissance and being
preached as the savior at the cost of relegating OO to its
oblivion. OO is a great tool set in our arsenal for certain types of
problem domain and SmallTalk is an example of how it should be
practiced. FP is another excellent way of approaching to engineering
problem in that it encourages to treat systems as referential data
transformation pipeline. Does it inherently make the system easy to
change? Not really. We are quite capable of making a spaghetti mess
out of FP as much as we have done with OO. See a pattern here? ETC
principle grounds your choice of paradigm into its proper place: Is
x helping you to make changes easier? If not, then x most likely not
best route for you.
</p>

<p>
I can go on and on with arguing ETC be the test to pass for all of the
paradigms and even development approaches such as TDD, BDD and
DDD. For example, If your code is easy to change, it will most likely
be easy to test, maps most likely well with your domain and most
likely models use cases better. You can adopt any approach or
principles such as SOLID principle if you consistently ask yourself:
Does this really helps me to make changes easier? If it passes this
test, adopt it, if not avoid it.
</p>

<p>
It is not my intention to make you dogmatic about <b>Easy To Change</b>
(ETC) principle but rather to convince yourself to have one principle
to ground all other aspects of your engineering endeavors. Happy
engineering and never forget to have and share fun coding!

Over the years, I got to learn various package managers either due to tinkering with work or home infrastructure. I need to keep remembering if I am on Ubuntu, OSX or on OpenBSD if I want to install/remove/list/update packages. wouldn't it be nice if all I need to remember is just one command <b>pkg</b> with following neumonic options?
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>s</b> for searching for a package</li>
<li><b>i</b> for install a package</li>
<li><b>r</b> for removing a package</li>
<li><b>l</b> for listing installed packages</li>
<li><b>c</b> for checking/cleaning packages</li>
</ul>

<p>
Following shell script does exactly that. And it could also serve as your reference to all unix package managers as an added benefit.

<div class="org-src-container">

If you happen to use Emacs and Eshell, you can just use following alias to get going:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Shell">alias pkg ./pkg '$*'
</pre>
</div>
<p>
Eshell aliases are great. You can pass arguments to them just prefixing aliases with '$*' as I did above. Try doing same with bash alias, you are out of luck and you have to write shell functions be able to do that. Enjoy!

<p>
One of the pain points of starting a new project or even hacking on existing project is to know where to start. One can start with documentation, test cases or even running it to see the logs and stacktraces (Stracktrace way is one of my favourite and you can tell a lot about code flow, organzation and you can even find un-handled bugs that way, which is a topic of its own for a blog post). Each language brings in its own set of tools that you need to know before you getting familiar with the code base. You might add `README` or some other documents to ease the pain but it might get stale overtime. One convention that I have been using, which has paid off with any project or teams that I have collaborated, are following simple conventions:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Each Project Should have a `Makefile` with following targets:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>setup</b> : Should take care of env configs</li>
<li><b>deps</b>  : Should take care of handling all the project dependencies</li>
<li><b>unit-test</b> : Should have local tests</li>
<li><b>integration-test</b> : Should have non local tests</li>
</ul></li>
<li>This Makefile should be self documenting:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It should have <b>help</b> as the default target that explains what the project is about and how to run it</li>
<li>It should be self documenting, meaning each target should have it is own description as to what it does and possible why it does it the way it is.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
Above might sound a lot to ask but it is really trivial to do those with just following make file:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Shell">.PHONY: help
help: ## This is a cool project. It does great things to help humanity move forward.
	@echo 'usage: make [target] ...'
	@echo
	@echo 'Targets Depends Description' | column -t -s ' '
	@echo '------- ------- -----------' | column -t -s ' '
	@egrep '^(.+)\:?.+\ ##\ (.+)' ${MAKEFILE_LIST} \
	| column -t -s ':#' | sed 's/Makefile  //'

setup: ## Sets up all that are needed start working on the project.
	@echo Setting up...
	# Put you logic here
	@echo Setting up done.

deps: setup ## Pulls in all required dependencies
	@echo Pulling all project dependencies

unit-test: deps ## Runs local tests
	@echo Running unit-tests...
	# Put your run unit-tests logic here
	@echo unit-tests done.

integration-test: deps ## Runs non local tests
	@echo Running integration-tests...
	# Put your run integration-tests logic here
	@echo integration-tests done.
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The presence of above Makefile should not be underestimated. It will allow yourself and your fellow developers to dive into any project with just one liner like this:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-Shell">git clone &lt;project&gt; &amp;&amp; cd project &amp;&amp; make deps
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Would not that be wonderful if every project just follow simple conventions like this so you have less obstacle to start or dive into a project? It has benefited me and my team over the years and hope you see the benefit for yourself.

<p>
<b>Disclaimer</b>: This is not a post about UNIX variants flame war. It is not my intention to recruit OpenBSD converts either as no one has influenced me to switch to it after 10 years of distro hopping. The main reasons I am using OpenBSD as my daily driver on both of my laptops (Thinkpad X220 and XPS 13 9365) are: <b>Security</b>, <b>Stability</b>, and <b>Frugality</b>.
</p>
<div id="outline-container-orge7546b5" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orge7546b5">Security</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orge7546b5">
<p>
I am software generalist who knows enough about system (OS,Network and Application) security to be paranoid not just about online systems, which is far from enough to keep ourselves secure, but also on-prem system such as Operating Systems we all rely on for keeping us safe. While Linux could be made as secure as OpenBSD after much tinkering and tweaking, OpenBSD is more secure by default installation. Following quote from <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/">https://www.openbsd.org/</a> is very telling:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Only two remote holes in the default install, in a heck of a long time!
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
That quote is for what OpenBSD team calls base file set that includes the kernel and base system. Security is the utmost priority for packages being included in the port tree as well. For example, Chromium comes with `&#x2013;enable-unveil` support, which means that it can only access `~/Downloads` folder to mitigate the attack surface if your browser ever gets hijacked.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org83844ce" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org83844ce">Stability</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org83844ce">
<p>
OpenBSD favors stability over new features. Once installed and configured to your liking, it just stays out of your way allowing you focus on your task at hand. You will not see nagging notifications demanding you to click on installing updates. You can just setup a cron to run `syspatch` to bring in security fixes whenever and however you like. Releases are scheduled for every 6 months in a predictable way so you are in control to plan it ahead. I am running 6.6 release and following errata proves my point: <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/errata66.html">https://www.openbsd.org/errata66.html</a>

<div id="outline-container-org12eac79" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org12eac79">Frugality</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org12eac79">
<p>
Wikipedia has the best definition for this and I believe it genuinely applies to the Philosophy of OpenBSD project. `Less is more` is a pretty well known Unix tradition and the command `less` (which is a replacement of early UNIX command `more`) is seen in every UNIX variants. OpenBSD is not the most user friendly Unix out there not even among BSD flavors. It is targeted towards security and resource savvy power users who wants have control over every piece of software running on their system. Every line of code is audited for frugality and not needed code is removed. Development is not driven by any cooperate or financial interest as apposed to the Operating System development from big Corporations such as Microsoft, Apple and Google. You can use your old hardware as long as it meets your needs and will not find yourself at the mercy of them nagging you upgrade your hardware let alone your system so often.
</p>

<p>
All in all, it gives you a piece of mind compared to any OS out there when it comes to knowing you are safe by default. If you would like to know more about why OpenBSD, you can visit this site for technical details:

I am currently running OpenBSD 6.6 on Thinkpad X220 (everything work out of the box) and Dell XPS 13 2 in 1 9365 (all works except for suspend - same as some leading Linux distros). The installation process is not that complicated (mostly you just except the default prompt by hitting enter) but does need some config to make it to your liking. I might blog about the installation process and list my configs for `X` and `cwm` in the future.
