<p>
StrangeLoop this year made me feel almost as normal as those during
pre pandemic times especially in terms of size of participants and
sponsors. I actually believe it had the most sponsorship so far among
those I attended over the years. One noticeable company was AWS that a
friend of mine joined earlier this year. So it was pretty exciting to
meet up with him there. As always, the breadths of folks and topics
from all walks of Software Engineering is just excellent this time as
well. I took few notes on the talks that I am able to attend and would
summarize them on few categories below.
</p>

<p>
<b>Dev Experience</b> : I consider observability to be an important part of
 development experience, which is always pushed back as an
 afterthought for almost all the startups that I worked with and I
 know of. The talk "Building Observability for 99% Developers" by Jean
 Yang just resonated with me and I am really glad that her company is
 building tools to make developer experience better using <a href="https://ebpf.io">eBPF</a> that
 has matured in the last few years. It was quite and entertaining talk
 and I highly recommend you check it out. Another talk that I really
 enjoyed is "Workflows, a new abstraction for distributed systems" by
 Dominik Tornow. If you are dealing with the chaos of distributed
 services, the abstraction that he presented make you feel like you
 are working with monolith (oh the happy times :) again with the
 advantage of cloud scalibility.
</p>

<p>
<b>Programming Languages</b> : I personally prefer dynamic languages
 (Clojure to be exact) as my tools of choice for my day to day
 practice of solving problems for people but I do see the benefit of
 type system as a guiding rail when designing an API or better yet
 generating code. You should check out the talk "Codegen with Types,
 for Humans, by Humans" by Matthew Griffith, where he talks about how
 to use types to generate code for human consumption. If you are
 working with (or say fighting with) type system that is complecting
 your business logic/code execution, you should check out the talk
 "Monad I Love You Now Get Out Of My Type System" by Gjeta Gjyshinca,
 where she talks about the platform that helps Scala developer to get
 their type system out of business logic with just five extra
 characters, @node, with a compiler plugin.
</p>

<p>
<b>Data Centric Problem Solving</b> : Strange Loop Conf have always been
 attractive to data centric practices and paradigms and this year was
 no different. There are many talks related to how to generate,
 architect and analyze data. The talk titled "Data-driven
 investigation in defense of human rights" by Christo Buschek is
 presented with very clear and methodical approaches to solve real
 problems we face around the world. I really feel like we need more of
 that type of work where we put technology for the benefit of our
 fellow human beings. I think he should do another presentation next
 year titled "Data-driven investigation in defense of peace and
 opposition of war", which surely makes me sign up for Strange Loop
 for one last time (Next year will be the last time you can experience
 Strange Loop and I highly recommend you attend to see what you have
 been missing).

Security is somewhat cat and mouse game. This does not mean however
you be careless or just live with what you are handed to when it comes
to protecting yourself from ill-intentioned actors out in the
wild. Generally, I recommend choosing security over convenience, speed
or shiny features for your offline and online computing needs. To
start with, you are much better protected if you start using secure
defaults of the system you are using. For example, Firefox has
<b>HTTPS-Only Mode</b> that you can enable especially if you find yourself
using public wifi. If you happen to use OpenBSD, you are in a treat
:). Below bash script will allow you to log in to public wifi using
random MAC addresses each time you connect to it: <b>NOTE:</b> iwm0 is the
wireless card name on my laptop and you need to replace it with yours.
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-shell">#!/usr/bin/env bash

ssid="$1"
pass="$2"
doas ifconfig iwm0 up
sleep 3
echo Wireless card is up

if [[ -z "$pass" ]]; then
    doas ifconfig iwm0 nwid "$ssid" lladdr random
    echo Joining public $ssid
else
    doas ifconfig iwm0 nwid "$ssid" wpakey "$pass"
    echo Joining private $ssid
fi

sleep 3

doas dhcpleasectl iwm0

echo Renewing inet address
sleep 3

echo Visiting google.com to test connection
proxy=$(curl -s -L -I -o /dev/null -w '%{url_effective}' google.com)

firefox $proxy

<p>
I blogged previously about why one should use OpenBSD and this time I
would like to document steps to have a fully working Xfce Desktop with
default installation. My goal is to keep the changes minimal only to
absolutely required steps, nothing more nothing less. If you find
steps missing (or did not work as expected) or not necessary, please
drop me a line via k tuman at acm dot org so I can address and update
this blog if needed.

Download the img and make USB boot disk:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-shell">curl -O https://cdn.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/7.0/amd64/install70.img
sudo dd if=~/Downloads/install70.img of=/path/to/usb
</pre>
</div></li>
<li>Boot from USB disk. Press <b>I</b> and hit enter when you see the
`Welcome to the OpenBSD/amd64 7.0 installation program.` and follow
the prompt. It is pretty straightforward. Once it is done, just
reboot, which will automatically downloads and installs needed
firmwares for your laptop.
--<b>NOTE:</b>&#x2013; You can select whole disk and auto layout if you are not
sure. Using wired connection for network interface is highly recommended.</li>
<li><p>
Once you login, switch to root account, add needed packages and
needed configs like this:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-shell">su  ## prompts for root password
pkg_add xfce xfce-extras ## install xfce desktop
sed -i 's/xconsole/#xconsole/' /etc/X11/xenodm/Xsetup_0 # no xconcole
usermod -G operator &lt;user name&gt; # so you can use xfce to log out, reboot etc
usermod -G wheel &lt;user name&gt; # so you can use doas
echo "permit persist :wheel" &gt;&gt; /etc/doas.conf # doas = sudo
rcctl enable messagebus ## enable dbus
rcctl start messagebus ## start dbus
rcctl enable apmd ## enable power daemon
rcctl start apmd  ## start power daemon
exit # switch to your user account
echo "exec startxfce4" &gt; ~/.xsession ## auto launchs xfce4 desktop
doas reboot ## restart to have a xfce default desktop
</pre>
</div></li>
</ol>

<p>
<b>Bonus Tips and Tricks</b>
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
Your wifi most likely will just work. In case if you get unlucky,
here is how you can get it working:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-shell">doas ifconfig # lists all supported interfaces
doas fw_update # to install missing driver for your card
dmesg | grep pci | grep &lt;wifi card model&gt; # report if not supported
doas ifconfig # again to check if your card listed
doas ifconfig join &lt;Wifi name&gt; wpakey &lt;password&gt; # to join your wifi
# Run following 2 lines if you want to auto join your wifi:
doas echo "join wifiname wpakey password" &gt;&gt; /etc/hostname.&lt;wificardname&gt;
doas echo "dhcp" &gt;&gt; /etc/hostname.&lt;wificardname&gt;
doas sh /etc/netstart # to restart the network
ping openbsd.org # to test your network
</pre>
</div></li>
<li><p>
While default Xfce4 desktop is fully functional out of the box, I
recommend following packages:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-shell">doas pkg_add xfce4-power-manager xfce4-whiskermenu
ln -s -f yourloginpics ~/.face # profile in whiskermenu and in lock screen
</pre>
</div>
<p>
Add them to the panel and tweak them to your liking. One setting I
highly recommend enabling following in `Window Manager Tweaks`:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>[✓] <b>Hide title of windows when maximized</b></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
This year's Strange Loop was my 4th and it was as good as it has been
in the past. One of the main reason I like to go to conferences
especially Strange Loop was to see beyond the state of the art
transmittable knowledge, which is the untransimittable one. In this
age of Google search, Stack Overflow copy/paste and Coding school
driven programming, which has its own place in our industry, we need
to be cognizant of the existence and importance of the
untransimittable part of software engineering knowledge that can only
be acquired by learning from the masters. And Strange Loop has never
failed me so far to provide an opportunity to jolt my brain to find
easier those tacit knowledge that otherwise might have taken me long
winding road to acquire. I would like to present few of those that I
have taken notes so it will help my aspiring fellow engineers.
</p>

<p>
<b>Domain Driven Design</b> : There are numerous books/posts/videos about
 how to do it right and I have been using it with success for the last
 few years. However, I have always been little bit unclear about how I
 measure its benefit within my engineering team. I got the `AHA`
 moment when second day keynote put up a quote on its slide stating
 that 'Small change in product (Domain), should result in small change
 in the code (implementation)'. Now, I know how to measure if we are
 doing it right or wrong in my team.
</p>

<p>
<b>API Design</b> : There is a talk about using Rust's type system in
 aiding you to design a robust API that does validation and error
 reporting right. While that talk focus on how Rust type system is
 tremendously useful to library (API) designer, what I see from that
 talk is way beyond just helpfulness of a well designed type system,
 which is a languages ability to allow you to specify your system's
 interfaces exactly as you intended. If you are not using one of those
 languages (Rust, F#, Ada and Clojure &#x2026; any language that allows you
 specify interfaces) in your library/API work, you should be checking
 them out to see what you are missing (also remember to keep an eye
 for what you are loosing. It is all about trade offs).
</p>

<p>
<b>Dependencies</b> : This is a topic that is very dear to day to day
 practice considering my current preferred tool of choice (Clojure and
 ClojureScript). The branchstack talk triggered sort of `AHA` moment
 for me in treating the entire state of your system (code) vs the
 state of your outside dependencies. I'd like to think of them as your
 internal state vs external state. I have been advocating and
 practicing a sort of convention your system should only be just three steps
 away from being able to be worked upon, which is:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-shell">git clone &lt;your_system_x&gt; &amp;&amp; make deps &amp;&amp; make run
</pre>
</div>
<p>
Note that it does not have to be git and make. Any tool of your
choice will do. The idea is that as a project owner, it is your
responsibility to make sure that your system workflow is easily
reproducible and those tools should be treated as first class citizen
as your system logic code.
</p>

<p>
Again, those kind of tacit knowledge can only be learned by being in
the presence of crafts people and having actually conversation with
them in close vicinity. I have enjoyed all the talks that I attended
and even more so the hallway and lunch table conversation. And I am
looking forward to Strange Loop 2022 already :).

<p>
One of the feature of Eshell that took me sometime to really
appreciate is its built-in ability to emulate Plan9 smart Shell. It
allows you to run a script or a command, run it again by just hitting
enter key after you modify it, say you made a mistake or want to
change part of it using Emacs editing power. You might say that you
can do same thing in any terminal using your up arrow key and command
line editing. But I challenge you to try it until you fully realize
the advantage you have vs regular terminal. Below is a simple screen
recording to show you what I mean:

<p>
I recommend you read following post to learn more about smart shell
and more about eshell including aliases:

This concludes my `Why Eshell` series. Hope you find it useful and
happy Eshelling!

<p>
Since eshell buffer is just a regular emacs buffer, we have all of the
emacs power at our disposal. In part 3 of my post, I briefly alluded
to multiple terminal management by just using few lines of elisp and
all without using any third party packages. I am posting the main elisp
function for posterity here:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(defun krun (cmd)
  (interactive
   (list
    (ido-completing-read
     "Enter cmd to run (append ##name for buffer name): "
     (let ((history nil))
       ;; We have to build up a list ourselves from the ring vector.
       (dotimes (index (ring-length keshell-history-global-ring))
	 (push (ring-ref keshell-history-global-ring index) history))
       ;; Show them most-recent-first.
       (setq history (nreverse history))))))
  (let* ((cmds (split-string cmd "##"))
	 (tag (or (-&gt; cmds second)
		  "kshell"))
	 (buff-name (-&gt; tag s-chomp s-trim)))
    (kshell cmd buff-name)))
</pre>
</div>
<p>
The above function (along with those from the previous post) will
allow you to do following:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Start a new shell with a specific name by just appending
##buffer-name after the command</li>
<li>Run a command from history or new command in a dedicated eshell
buffer, which defaults to <b>kshell</b>. You can override as any name you
want.</li>
<li>Use all hotkeys, interactive lisp functions as you would for regular
emacs buffer. For example, you can do buffer switching, ibuffer
management, isearch, protect a buffer from being killed, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Following demonstrates above cases I am talking about:
