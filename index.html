<p>
Clojure has number special forms. Among them are <b>let</b> and
<b>binding</b> that are implemented as macros. For new comers to Clojure,
above can be confusing to understand, which I hope to address in this
blog post. If you have read "Programming Clojure" book, you might be
thinking that it is easy to use them correctly considering following
straightforward example:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-clojure">(def x 7) ;; bind the var x to the value 7
(defn print-x [x]
  (println x))

(let [x 9]
  (print-x)) ;; prints 7

(binding [x 9]
  (print-x)) ;; prints 9
</pre>
</div>
<p>
Why? Because <b>let</b> creates a lexical scoped vars, which is local to
the code block or functions where it is initially defined while <b>def</b>
creates a global var that is visible to all functions under the
namespace that you are in. Therefore, in the example above, <b>let</b> just
created a new "x" with the value of 9. But it is not local to the
function "print-x". That is to say, "print-x" have no knowledge of the
local scoped binding that is created by <b>let</b>. <b>binding</b> macro instead
creates a new binding for the already existed var, "x" with the value
of 9. Since "print-x" is evaluated within the <b>binding</b> form, the
newly bound value is visible to any chained calls within the form. All
nice and easy. However, it is not that obvious to understand and use
them correctly. Look at following example:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-clojure">(def x 7)
(def y 9)

(let [x 5 y x] y) ;; returns 5
(binding [x 5 y x] y) ;; returns 7
</pre>
</div>
<p>
<b>let</b> example is just fine. It created a new var "y" with the value of
5 bound to it. But what is going on with the <b>binding</b> example? If we
dig little deeper to Clojure API doc, we learn that the new bindings
in <b>binding</b> are made in parallel, not sequential as it is in <b>let</b>.
Therefore, existing var "y" gets bound to the root binding of "x" not
the overshadowed value of "x", which is the case in the <b>let</b> example.
OK, so far so good. Let us look at another example:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-clojure">(defn print-x [&amp; args]
  (println "print-x prints: " args))
(defn print-y [&amp; args]
  (println "print-y prints: " args))
(let [print-x print-y] (print-x 123)) ;; print-y prints: (1 2 3)
(binding [print-x print-y] (print-x 123)) ;; print-y prints: (1 2 3)
(binding [print-x print-y] #(print-x 123)) ;; prints
					     ;; cryptic "#&lt;user$eval__28$fn__30
					     ;; user$eval__28$fn__30@bdb503&gt;"
((binding [print-x print-y] #(print-x 123))) ;; print-x prints: (1 2 3)
</pre>
</div>
<p>
All the lines but the last two are pretty straight forward. But how
about the last line? Shouldn't it call "print-y" function? Not really.
It is because the anonymous function is evaluated outside of the
<b>binding</b> form. The "#&lt;user$eval_<sub>28</sub>$fn_<sub>30</sub>
user$eval_<sub>28</sub>$fn_<sub>30</sub>@bdb503&gt;" is an indication that anonymous function
did not get evaluated. The extra parens evals above form. Ok,
now, how do you make sure it evaluates within the <b>binding</b> form? Just
enclose the anonymous function within parenthesis. What do we learn
from all of the above? Here are the summary that helps one use <b>let</b>
and <b>binding</b> correctly:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Use <b>binding</b> only if you are trying to alter a behavior dynamically
for special-vars that is already defined. Enclose your special vars
within * as recommended by idiomatic clojure to make your intent
clear.</li>
<li>Use <b>let</b> for locally scoped vars and avoid shadowing already
defined vars.</li>
<li>Remember <b>let</b> binding is sequential and <b>binding</b> binding is done in parallel.</li>
<li>Pay close attention to the scope of the <b>binding</b> form. Any
expression that is not evaluated inside the form, will not see the
binding. That is to say, binding in <b>binding</b> form is thread local
starting from the <b>binding</b> form until it ends including any
expression that is chained within the form, which is what the
thread-local are all about.</li>
<li>Lastly avoid using <b>binding</b> as much as possible. I have seen many
production bugs related to issues I outlined here.</li>

<p>
I am pretty excited to learn that Strange Loop is happening this
year! It is one of the few technical conference that I always
recommend to my fellow teammates. What is more exciting are the
sessions including few keynotes. What this has to do with the
topic of the blog post, which is on programming style, you say? If you
squint at the sessions, the author of <b>Exercises in Programming Style</b>
is the first keynote speaker. It is one of the best book on programming I
have ever read in recent years. I am not going to spoil it here with
summary or gist but I'd like share few take home points I really liked
about the book.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Having a clear, well understood programming problem throughout the
book: given a text file, we want to display the N (e.g. 25) most
frequent words and corresponding frequencies ordered by decreasing
value of frequency. Once the understanding what problem we are
dealing with out of the way, the remaining is just choosing a style
to solve it, which the book does fantastic job to explain. It even
has full source code in the book.</li>
<li>Concise and clear way of making the reader understand many programming
techniques that one might otherwise gets really confused. For
example, Monads, CPS (continuation passing style), FRP and many
others.</li>
<li>Have you ever wondered how neural networks (NN) works? Second
edition have you covered with clear explanation and code as she has
done with many concepts from the first edition.</li>
</ul>

<p>
I strongly recommend the book to both novice or pros alike. It is a
book that you rarely see in terms of style and clarity with full
working code. We really need this kind of books more to have
programming accessible and understood by more people. I do believe it
is a classic. If you are planning to attend Strange Loop, remember to
say hello and thank her for it.

<p>
As an Emacs user, your muscle memories constantly remind you of
certain behavior of it when you had to use other Unix tools. I was
recently viewing a large file using <b>less</b> and searched for
<b>ErrorCode</b> by just typing <b>errorcode</b> and surprised to find that it
did not find any match. Then, I searched by typing <b>ErrorCode</b> and it
did find a match containing the word, which reminded me of the fact
that <b>less</b> by default is case sensitive. I then set out to find if I
can tell <b>less</b> to ignore case by reading man pages. I am pleasantly
surprised to read following:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-bash">-i or --ignore-case
	      Causes searches to ignore case; that is, uppercase and lowercase
	      are  considered identical.  This option is ignored if any upper-
	      case letters appear in the search pattern; in other words, if  a
	      pattern  contains  uppercase  letters, then that search does not
	      ignore case.
</pre>
</div>
<p>
That is exactly how Emacs isearch behaves by default. I added
following alias to my bash config to make above the default for less.
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-bash">alias less='less -i'
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Once again, less is <b>literally</b> more and you could do more using less.

<p>
A web application tinkerer deals with malformed inputs, faulty
networks, buggy software and everything in between. One tool that
saved the day on more than one occasion is: <b>cURL</b>, which should be
under every engineers' arsenal. Following are two examples how it
proved to be just the right tool to reach for.
</p>

<p>
Among many micro services writtent in Clojure, one of them exposed
following logic via a REST API:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Take a shortened URL, expand it to find the actual
URL it is pointing to, and parse URL param to generate a JSON object
of k/v to return to the caller.</li>
</ul>

<p>
One of our client reported a bug where their Ad data dashboard did not
show up one day. Looking at the log trace, I realized that above
service might be failing. I had a choice of starting a full suite of
our services to reproduce it or just using cURL from the terminal to
find out what the Ad URL expanded to. Here is an example:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-bash">curl -ILs https://bit.ly/2MSn9Xm
</pre>
</div>
<p>
Following is the output:

The options <b>-ILs</b> tells cURL to query resource headers with location
information in silent mode. After seeing the location information of
the client's Ad URL, I was able to pinpoint the missing url param from
the source data that our client is expecting. Once I informed this
info to our client, they are able to fix their own issue with grace.
</p>

<p>
Second time cURL came to the rescue is when a developer from
my team reached out to me for a mysterious bug he was experiencing. An
API call was failing for 50% of the time with truncated response that
was causing error on his application. Not knowing anything about the
application much, I asked him to call the API using cURL to eliminate
the possibility of OS network related issues. Once I know that the API
work is working 100% of the time via cURL, I narrowed the issues down
to the application code. The application is written in Node and
following are abbreviated version of how the JS code looks like:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-javascript">function getFoo(){
  return axios.get(urlFoo)
}

function getBar(url){
  return axios.get(url)
}

function getFooBar(){
 var foo = getFoo(); //block until we have a result
 // this line below was failing due to malformed foo becuase it is truncated
 var url = "magicUrl" //parse `foo`, construct url
 var bar = getBar(url)
 return parse(bar)
}

</pre>

My teammate said that he did try increasing the timeout of the `axios`
library but it did not help. I asked him to see if `axios` have
some configuration setting related to buffer size or connection, and he
confirmed that it does have `connection reuse` setting where it is
default value are `false`. I asked him to try setting it to `true`,
which he did and voila, API call went through with 100% success
rate. Now, our problem is solved and we can move on with our
lives.

I just want to convince you how usefull <b>cURL</b> command is and you
should use it whenever you can. I might write a post in the future on
why the response was getting truncated and why reusing the connection
helped solve the issue.

<p>
If you are just curious about the ETC principle to ground all other
principles of software engineering, you can scroll all the way down of
this post to find out what I meant by ETC. If you know what ETC stands
for and are already grounding your engineering efforts, you can just
skip this post and go on with your MIT (most important task). However,
If you are skeptical, which you always should be, you might want to
read on to learn why.
</p>

<p>
As an Engineer, our primary function on daily basis is to come up
with a working solution to a specific problem that arose out of
need from our <b>users</b>. I highlight the word user here since the user
could be our end user, could be our fellow engineers, or could just be
ourselves. If you have been in the industry for a while, you might
have been exposed to plethora of must follow principles and practices
from existing literature, which I categorize as `transmittable`
knowledge. Apart from that, there is another type of knowledge that I
would like to classify as `untransmittable` where you have to
experience it to make it your own. Those two types of knowledge
corresponds to how we learn new things: 1. We read transmittable
knowledge from various sources 2. We bring them into our practice to
form our deep understanding of it. Only then, we are able to utilize
our newly learned knowledge effectively to achieve our end result,
which is by the way to meet the needs of our fellow <b>users</b> as apposed
to the need of certain systems. Now, let us stack ETC principle
against three of the most well known engineering paradigms so we are
always grounded in our approach to utilizing them.

<h2 id="org7665c2a">Monolith vs Microservice</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org7665c2a">
<p>
We have come a long way since the 1950s in our approach to different
design and architectural paradigms. Over the last 10 years or so, we
all have been preached to about how great Microservice is and have drunk its
Kool-Aid. It has penetrated engineering organizations to such a degree
that it has become our new hammer. Now all of a sudden, we start
waking up to its trade offs and even going back to old monolith
architecture. What happened? We just did not ground ourselves when
we made a decision to adopt microservice style. The question we should
have asked ourselves before committing to microservice or monolith is:
How it enables us to make whatever we are doing easy to change? Does
monolith style make our system easy to change? Maybe. Does
microservice approach enables us easy to change our system? Maybe. So
the definite answer to both questions is "it depends". So what should
be the basis of our decision to go with one way or the other? Maybe
an example in order to drive my point here. Let's say you're
designing an e-commerce system. It has catalog, checkout and shipping
components. Does putting all of the components into one service make
the system easy to change for you? May be it will if you are the only
person or your team are the only team working on it. Does putting all
of the components into separate services make the system easy to
change? May be it will if you have three separate teams working on
them.

<h2 id="orgcf7d58f">Top down vs bottom up design</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgcf7d58f">
<p>
I have seen teams swear by one way or the other on this matter. From
time to time, someone comes along to preach one over the other
declaring the other approach is dead or should just be avoided. Every
time when I face such a design issue, I always ask myself this
question over and over again: Does top down or bottom up design
enables me or my team to respond to change? Most of the time, I end up
choosing both approaches because it helps me to focus on making the
system easier to change. I tend to use following rule of thumb. When I
have clear mental model, I use the bottom up approach so I can create
layers of abstractions to compose better, which in turn enables me to
make changes easier. When I have a high level of domain clarity, I
tend to start with top down design because it helps me to focus on not
that clear pieces in isolation, which in turn makes changes a lot more
manageable.

<div id="outline-container-org7672d35" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org7672d35">OO vs FP paradigm</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org7672d35">
<p>
I was preached and have been preaching OO style of programming
paradigm from since my college days and well into the early years of my
profession. Then FP became the new style (old became new?) and all OO
programming languages started to add more FP style constructs. Now we
see debates over why FP is superior over OO and should be used over
all cost claiming that OO is responsible for all the mess that we
created over the last 20 years or so. Now, I came to realize that it
is not this or that paradigm that is responsible for all the issues we
created. Rather, it is the blind adoption of them by us as
practitioners. Let us think about a minute what OO have given us when
we started to adopt it: The ability to structure, reuse and share code
across systems. Essentially, we were able to build/change information
systems faster and easier than ever before. However, it did not hold
up well against ETC principle with its humongous frameworks and so
called best practices. Now, FP is in its renaissance and being
preached as the savior at the cost of relegating OO to its
oblivion. OO is a great tool set in our arsenal for certain types of
problem domain and SmallTalk is an example of how it should be
practiced. FP is another excellent way of approaching to engineering
problem in that it encourages to treat systems as referential data
transformation pipeline. Does it inherently make the system easy to
change? Not really. We are quite capable of making a spaghetti mess
out of FP as much as we have done with OO. See a pattern here? ETC
principle grounds your choice of paradigm into its proper place: Is
x helping you to make changes easier? If not, then x most likely not
best route for you.
</p>

<p>
I can go on and on with arguing ETC be the test to pass for all of the
paradigms and even development approaches such as TDD, BDD and
DDD. For example, If your code is easy to change, it will most likely
be easy to test, maps most likely well with your domain and most
likely models use cases better. You can adopt any approach or
principles such as SOLID principle if you consistently ask yourself:
Does this really helps me to make changes easier? If it passes this
test, adopt it, if not avoid it.
</p>

<p>
It is not my intention to make you dogmatic about <b>Easy To Change</b>
(ETC) principle but rather to convince yourself to have one principle
to ground all other aspects of your engineering endeavors. Happy
engineering and never forget to have and share fun coding!
