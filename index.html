<p>
1913 Webster dictionary gives following definition to Artificial Intelligence:
<b>Artificial</b> - 1. Made or contrived by art; produced or modified by
human skill and labor, in opposition to natural; 2. Feigned;
fictitious; assumed; affected; not genuine. 3. Artful; cunning;
crafty. 4. Cultivated; not indigenous; not of spontaneous growth;
<b>Intelligence</b> - 1. The act or state of knowing; the exercise of the
understanding. 2. The capacity to know or understand; readiness of
comprehension; the intellect, as a gift or an endowment. 3. Knowledge
imparted or acquired, whether by study, research, or experience;
general information. Specifically; (Mil.) Information about an enemy
or potential enemy, his capacities, and intentions.
</p>

<p>
Let us read and re-read above definitions and give it a few minutes to
sink in. With our skilled labor, we have managed to produce a very
powerful fictitious software that can understand, produce and reason
about human generated artifacts such as language, images and
videos. Our ability to make it more scalable, more accurate and more
controllable is just a matter of time considering what we have is
already pretty powerful enough. My following interaction with ChatGPT
3.5 is already impressive:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">[ME]: Explain, then add tests and simplify if possible:
(defun kprompt (&amp;optional p)
  (interactive "P")
  (let* ((bname (if p "*org-ai-on-region*" "*scratch*"))
         (directive "Explain, then add tests and simplify if possible:\n")
         (prompt (if p
                     (buffer-substring (region-beginning) (region-end))
                   (read-string "AI Chat Prompt: "))))
    (with-current-buffer (pop-to-buffer bname)
      (when p
        (erase-buffer)
        (org-mode)
        (setq truncate-lines nil)
        (setq word-wrap t)
        (org-ai--insert-created-timestamp)
        (insert "\n")
        (insert "#+begin_ai\n" "[ME]: " directive prompt "\n" "#+end_ai\n")
        (forward-line -1)
        (org-ai-complete-block))
      (when (not p)
        (beginning-of-buffer)
        (open-line 2)
        (org-ai-prompt prompt)))))

[AI]: This function takes an optional argument, p, which determines whether the user
will be prompted to enter a text or whether the function will use the text highlighted
in the buffer. 

If p is provided, it will create a new buffer with the name "*org-ai-on-region*" and
insert the highlighted text from the current buffer along with a directive. This new
buffer buffer will be formatted using org-mode to allow for better organization of
comprehension text. Finally, it will call org-ai-complete-block to add some
AI-generated text to the prompt.

If p is not provided, it will prompt the user to enter text and then call
org-ai-prompt org-ai-prompt to add some AI-generated text to the prompt.

Tests:

Input:
(kprompt)
Expected Output:
AI Chat Prompt: 

Input:
(kprompt t)
Expected Output:
*org-ai-on-region* buffer created with prompt

Input:
(Highlight "This is a test")
(kprompt t)
Expected output:
*org-ai-on-region* buffer created with "This is a test" text and AI-generated text.

Simplified Code:
The code appears to be relatively straightforward and efficient.
No simplification is needed.
</pre>

<p>
It understood and reasoned about a piece of code (simple for now but
does not matter as it can get pretty powerful in no time) despite the
fact that it has never seen above code before in its entirety (I am
pretty sure about that since it is a private code and this is the only
time I am making the code public). This degree of intelligence
codified into a software that a few powerful cooperation currently
dominates should be something that keeps every software engineers
awake at night. Not because of its inherent danger or tremendous
productivity boosting ability as folks on the opposite side of
spectrum of current AI debate claimed, but because of the very fact
that every aspect of human lives will be effected by a such a
powerful code like ChatGPT whether we like it or not, and we need
to do whatever we can to ensure it is used for the good of humanity in
general. It is created by humans and should serve humans. Make no
mistake about it. Powerful software systems like that is already used
by big cooperations and rouge states to cajole people into a state of
self censorship if not into a state of heedlessness of its future
implication. Social media, powerful tracking and image recognition
systems are already pervasive in the lives of millions of people that
are being controlled by dictators all around the world (and it is
being exported very actively in the name of economic progress) to
socially engineer people's behaviors that benefits their agenda in
the name of social and economic progress at the very expense of
destroying anyone or anything that is deemed as an obstacle.
</p>

<p>
As a software engineer who have seen the worst of what bad actors can
do with such a powerful systems, I am calling out to all of my fellow
engineers to start thinking about what kind of world we would like our
kids to inherit from us regardless of where you are, who you are and
what is your geopolitical affiliation is. The wave is already there,
and it takes all of us to make sure we are not being social
engineered out of our humanity. I believe in the power of our humanity
to make AI to work for us not the other way around. I registered the
domain <b>www.codeforhumanrights.org</b> few years ago and this might be a
good time to start putting it to a good use. If you are reading this

<p>
Code complexity is something we all deal with in our daily work. There
are many tools to helps us manage it. One of the most important one is
to make incremental changes where each change is about <b>one and one
context alone</b> , which is a great definition of <b>an atomic commit</b>. I
do not think I need to convince you about its benefits any further
than what I already have alluded to above, which is worth repeating
here: It helps us contain complexity within our code base. In pursuit
of making it easy for me to do atomic commits, I settled down
following workflow:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Separate changes by its effects. If a change is immutable, that is
to say it is simple refactor or restructure that does not change the
existing behavior, it should be in one commit.</li>
<li>If changes are mutable, that is to say it changes existing behavior,
group them further by their logical context where the context is
about one and one thing alone. This is really crucial since we would
like to make sure every commit can stand on its own and does not
depend on later commits. This gives us the linear append only change
that we can easily keep track of. This might sound a bit strange to
you, but it means that you should not commit a not finished work at
least not push up stream. That also does not mean that you should
not commit your work as often as possible but if you do commit and
end up violating above convention, you should amend/squash your
commits.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Having armed with above convention, I incorporated following tools to
help me to make atomic commits easy:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/"><b>Emacs</b></a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/oneness/commit-patch"><b>commit-patch</b></a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/oneness/commit-patch/blob/master/commit-patch-buffer.el"><b>commit-patch-buffer</b></a></li>
</ul>

<p>
I am not going to repeat what the excellent <a href="https://porkrind.org/missives/commit-patch-managing-your-mess">blog</a> talked about above
tools here, but it is worth checking it out, and I highly recommend
it. If you happen to use Emacs, here is how you add it to your
config:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">
;; clone above repo in to ~/repos and eval following code
(load-file "~/repos/commit-patch/commit-patch-buffer.el")
(eval-after-load 'diff-mode
  '(require 'commit-patch-buffer nil 'noerror))

</pre>
</div>

<p>
With above configuration, you can M-x vc-diff a file (vc-root-diff for
whole project) then kill, split or edit the resulting hunks using diff
mode's built-in commands and to then hit C-c C-c to commit the
patch. Later if you realized that your commit is not atomic, you can
make further changes and amend previous commit by C-c C-C (note the
upper case C).

<p>
StrangeLoop this year made me feel almost as normal as those during
pre pandemic times especially in terms of size of participants and
sponsors. I actually believe it had the most sponsorship so far among
those I attended over the years. One noticeable company was AWS that a
friend of mine joined earlier this year. So it was pretty exciting to
meet up with him there. As always, the breadths of folks and topics
from all walks of Software Engineering is just excellent this time as
well. I took few notes on the talks that I am able to attend and would
summarize them on few categories below.
</p>

<p>
<b>Dev Experience</b> : I consider observability to be an important part of
 development experience, which is always pushed back as an
 afterthought for almost all the startups that I worked with and I
 know of. The talk "Building Observability for 99% Developers" by Jean
 Yang just resonated with me and I am really glad that her company is
 building tools to make developer experience better using <a href="https://ebpf.io">eBPF</a> that
 has matured in the last few years. It was quite and entertaining talk
 and I highly recommend you check it out. Another talk that I really
 enjoyed is "Workflows, a new abstraction for distributed systems" by
 Dominik Tornow. If you are dealing with the chaos of distributed
 services, the abstraction that he presented make you feel like you
 are working with monolith (oh the happy times :) again with the
 advantage of cloud scalibility.
</p>

<p>
<b>Programming Languages</b> : I personally prefer dynamic languages
 (Clojure to be exact) as my tools of choice for my day to day
 practice of solving problems for people but I do see the benefit of
 type system as a guiding rail when designing an API or better yet
 generating code. You should check out the talk "Codegen with Types,
 for Humans, by Humans" by Matthew Griffith, where he talks about how
 to use types to generate code for human consumption. If you are
 working with (or say fighting with) type system that is complecting
 your business logic/code execution, you should check out the talk
 "Monad I Love You Now Get Out Of My Type System" by Gjeta Gjyshinca,
 where she talks about the platform that helps Scala developer to get
 their type system out of business logic with just five extra
 characters, @node, with a compiler plugin.
</p>

<p>
<b>Data Centric Problem Solving</b> : Strange Loop Conf have always been
 attractive to data centric practices and paradigms and this year was
 no different. There are many talks related to how to generate,
 architect and analyze data. The talk titled "Data-driven
 investigation in defense of human rights" by Christo Buschek is
 presented with very clear and methodical approaches to solve real
 problems we face around the world. I really feel like we need more of
 that type of work where we put technology for the benefit of our
 fellow human beings. I think he should do another presentation next
 year titled "Data-driven investigation in defense of peace and
 opposition of war", which surely makes me sign up for Strange Loop
 for one last time (Next year will be the last time you can experience
 Strange Loop and I highly recommend you attend to see what you have
 been missing).

Security is somewhat cat and mouse game. This does not mean however
you be careless or just live with what you are handed to when it comes
to protecting yourself from ill-intentioned actors out in the
wild. Generally, I recommend choosing security over convenience, speed
or shiny features for your offline and online computing needs. To
start with, you are much better protected if you start using secure
defaults of the system you are using. For example, Firefox has
<b>HTTPS-Only Mode</b> that you can enable especially if you find yourself
using public wifi. If you happen to use OpenBSD, you are in a treat
:). Below bash script will allow you to log in to public wifi using
random MAC addresses each time you connect to it: <b>NOTE:</b> iwm0 is the
wireless card name on my laptop and you need to replace it with yours.
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-shell">#!/usr/bin/env bash

ssid="$1"
pass="$2"
doas ifconfig iwm0 up
sleep 3
echo Wireless card is up

if [[ -z "$pass" ]]; then
    doas ifconfig iwm0 nwid "$ssid" lladdr random
    echo Joining public $ssid
else
    doas ifconfig iwm0 nwid "$ssid" wpakey "$pass"
    echo Joining private $ssid
fi

sleep 3

doas dhcpleasectl iwm0

echo Renewing inet address
sleep 3

echo Visiting google.com to test connection
proxy=$(curl -s -L -I -o /dev/null -w '%{url_effective}' google.com)

firefox $proxy

<p>
I blogged previously about why one should use OpenBSD and this time I
would like to document steps to have a fully working Xfce Desktop with
default installation. My goal is to keep the changes minimal only to
absolutely required steps, nothing more nothing less. If you find
steps missing (or did not work as expected) or not necessary, please
drop me a line via k tuman at acm dot org so I can address and update
this blog if needed.

Download the img and make USB boot disk:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-shell">curl -O https://cdn.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/7.0/amd64/install70.img
sudo dd if=~/Downloads/install70.img of=/path/to/usb
</pre>
</div></li>
<li>Boot from USB disk. Press <b>I</b> and hit enter when you see the
`Welcome to the OpenBSD/amd64 7.0 installation program.` and follow
the prompt. It is pretty straightforward. Once it is done, just
reboot, which will automatically downloads and installs needed
firmwares for your laptop.
--<b>NOTE:</b>&#x2013; You can select whole disk and auto layout if you are not
sure. Using wired connection for network interface is highly recommended.</li>
<li><p>
Once you login, switch to root account, add needed packages and
needed configs like this:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-shell">su  ## prompts for root password
pkg_add xfce xfce-extras ## install xfce desktop
sed -i 's/xconsole/#xconsole/' /etc/X11/xenodm/Xsetup_0 # no xconcole
usermod -G operator &lt;user name&gt; # so you can use xfce to log out, reboot etc
usermod -G wheel &lt;user name&gt; # so you can use doas
echo "permit persist :wheel" &gt;&gt; /etc/doas.conf # doas = sudo
rcctl enable messagebus ## enable dbus
rcctl start messagebus ## start dbus
rcctl enable apmd ## enable power daemon
rcctl start apmd  ## start power daemon
exit # switch to your user account
echo "exec startxfce4" &gt; ~/.xsession ## auto launchs xfce4 desktop
doas reboot ## restart to have a xfce default desktop
</pre>
</div></li>
</ol>

<p>
<b>Bonus Tips and Tricks</b>
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
Your wifi most likely will just work. In case if you get unlucky,
here is how you can get it working:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-shell">doas ifconfig # lists all supported interfaces
doas fw_update # to install missing driver for your card
dmesg | grep pci | grep &lt;wifi card model&gt; # report if not supported
doas ifconfig # again to check if your card listed
doas ifconfig join &lt;Wifi name&gt; wpakey &lt;password&gt; # to join your wifi
# Run following 2 lines if you want to auto join your wifi:
doas echo "join wifiname wpakey password" &gt;&gt; /etc/hostname.&lt;wificardname&gt;
doas echo "dhcp" &gt;&gt; /etc/hostname.&lt;wificardname&gt;
doas sh /etc/netstart # to restart the network
ping openbsd.org # to test your network
</pre>
</div></li>
<li><p>
While default Xfce4 desktop is fully functional out of the box, I
recommend following packages:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-shell">doas pkg_add xfce4-power-manager xfce4-whiskermenu
ln -s -f yourloginpics ~/.face # profile in whiskermenu and in lock screen
</pre>
</div>
<p>
Add them to the panel and tweak them to your liking. One setting I
highly recommend enabling following in `Window Manager Tweaks`:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>[✓] <b>Hide title of windows when maximized</b></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
