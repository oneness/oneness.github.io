<p>
Nix is started in 2003 as a research project aimed to solve the
problem of <b>reliable software deployment</b>. The PhD thesis titled <b>The
Purely Functional Software Deployment Model</b> proposed a novel way of
building software where the final artifact is purely dependent on the
inputs to the build system, which is a pure function in a mathematical
sense. Regardless of where you are in your nix journey, I can't
recommend this paper (<a href="https://edolstra.github.io/pubs/phd-thesis.pdf">thesis</a>) enough. It is very approachable and
worth a read so you learn from first principle of what, why and how
about Nix.
</p>

<p>
Nix is a software build and management system that can replace
traditional package managers, build environments and configuration
tools. Due to the inherent complexity of the problem domain nix is
designed to solve and its long history, it has pretty steep learning
curve but not unsurmountable. One of the common point of confusions is
how the term `Nix` is used in documentations, tutorials and
blogosphere. So let me clarify few terminologies that often gets
overloaded. 
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Nix:</b> Unless otherwise fully qualified, I use it to mean the
software build and management system.</li>
<li><b>Nix CLI:</b> The nix command line client that one uses to interact with nix.</li>
<li><b>Nix DSL:</b> The domain specific language that nix uses to generate a
software package. I would like to see everyone start using it to
mean the nix language.</li>
<li><b>Flakes:</b> A Nix DSL with number of conventions that is designed to
ease the configuration and discoverability of software packaging lifecycle.</li>
<li><b>NixOS:</b> The final artifact, which is happened to be a Linux
Operating System that is generated by feeding Nix DSL to nix. I will
not be covering it in this blog post.</li>
</ul>

<p>
After few false starts and restarts, below are what I believe to be
better ways for getting started, using nix for fun and profit.
</p>
<div id="outline-container-org2f32676" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org2f32676">Installation</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org2f32676">
<p>
I have a following bash script to install a specific version so I can
have control over which version to install, what features enable and
disable.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-bash">#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -Eeuo pipefail

VERSION='2.28.1' # replace it with the latest version
URL="https://releases.nixos.org/nix/nix-${VERSION}/install"
MY_CONF="$HOME/.dotfiles/nix/nix.conf"
sh &lt;(curl --location "${URL}") \
     --daemon \
     --no-channel-add \
     --nix-extra-conf-file ${MY_CONF}
# conf file has this content
experimental-features = nix-command flakes
</pre>
</div>
<p>
The `&#x2013;no-channel-add` and the extra conf file needs some
explanation. Nix called a remote url a channel that gets automatically
installed, where nix uses to retrieve package definitions (Nix DSL) to
manage packages. It introduces a state, which is currently installed
channel url that is outside of Nix DSL, thus defeating the purpose of
reproducibility. It is considered legacy feature and not needed by
flakes, an experimental feature already widely adopted by the
community. So I highly recommend enabling flakes and additional
commands to interact with it.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org2b5adb4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org2b5adb4">Using for fun and sanity</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org2b5adb4">
<p>
Every project depends on existing software that is beyond your
control. Nix DSL enables you to declaratively specify your projects
dependencies, a repo or a tar-ball down to the file digest of its
content, which is what gives nix superpowers of being a deterministic
and reproducible package manager. This means that if your inputs stays
the same, nix guarantees that it produces the exact same output
regardless of when and where. Below is a flake that pulls in latest
version of Clojure into your project.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-nix">{
  # optional attribute
  description = "My awesome Clojure/ClojureScript project";

  # required attribute
  inputs = {
    # nix dsl fns useful for writing flakes
    flake-utils.url = "github:numtide/flake-utils/v1.0.0";
    # Pins state of the packages to a specific commit sha
    pinnedPkgs.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs/c46290747b2aaf090f48a478270feb858837bf11";
  };

  # required attribute
  outputs = { self, flake-utils, pinnedPkgs }@inputs :
  flake-utils.lib.eachDefaultSystem (system:
  let pinnedSysPkgs = inputs.pinnedPkgs.legacyPackages.${system};
  in
  {
    devShells.default = pinnedSysPkgs.mkShell {
      packages = [
        pinnedSysPkgs.clojure
      ];

      # commands to run in the development interactive shell
      shellHook = ''
        echo To get Clojure REPL, Run:
        echo clojure
        echo To get ClojureScript REPL, Run:
        echo clj -Sdeps \'{:deps {org.clojure/clojurescript {:mvn/version "1.11.132"}}}\' -M -m cljs.main --repl
      '';
    };
    packages = {
      docker = pinnedSysPkgs.dockerTools.buildLayeredImage {
        name = "My awesome Clj docker image built by nix";
        tag = "latest";
        contents = [pinnedSysPkgs.clojure];
      };
    };
  });
}

</pre>
</div>

<p>
Do not worry too much about not understanding above nix dsl code. The
most important thing to know is that it is nix dsl referred to as a
flake that specifies its inputs and outputs declaratively. Save above
code as `flake.nix`, which is a convention, then run `nix develop` to
get an interactive shell with Clojure in your path. Nix can do way
more than this. However, I recommend you just start with solving
project dependencies problem. Above flake gives you following
benefits:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Ability to pin the exact versions of your project dependencies.</li>
<li>Cross platform development environment that works
both in MacOS and various flavors of Linux.</li>
<li>Determinate and reproducible development environment that
eliminates "it works on my machine" tooling issues.</li>
</ul>
<p>
One important thing to notice here is the way I chose to reference
the url inputs of the flake. I deliberately used tags or commit sha to
prevent the state of the urls (thus the state of the nix DSL) change
under me, which defeats the purpose of having a determinate
and reproducible way to get a development environment. I have
following bash script that prints available tags and corresponding
commit hash:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-bash"> git_tag_sha () {
   repo="$1"
   echo "********************************************************"
   echo "Available release and commit sha for pinning are:"
   echo "********************************************************"
   printf "\033[1m%-12s %s\033[0m\n" "release" "commit sha"
   curl -s https://github.com/$repo/tags | grep -oP 'href="\K[^"]*(releases/tag|nixpkgs/commit)[^"]*' | awk -F '/' 'NR%2{tag=$NF; next} {printf "%-12s %s\n", tag, $NF}'
   echo
   echo "****************************************************************************"
   echo "Please replace the commit sha of following line to pin pkgs to a commit sha: "
   echo "pinnedPkgs.url = github:$repo/&lt;commit&gt;"
   echo "****************************************************************************"
   echo
}
# You can run it like this:
 git_tag_sha "NixOS/nixpkgs"
</pre>

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgec3469a">
<p>
This is probably one of the most frictionless and rewarding outcome of
using nix. Nix is designed to solve the problem of software deployment
after all but the wholesale adoption in production might prove to be
too much for the final gain. To spare yourself countless hours of
frustration, I highly recommend you start with using it to build
docker image if you happened to use docker and Kubernetes. Nix has
superb built-in support for making the smallest possible docker image
otherwise impossible. Above flake already includes `docker` image as
one of its packages output. Here is how you build and load the docker image:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-bash">nix build .#docker # the image will be in ./result
docker load &lt; ./result # to get it ready to be deployed
</pre>
</div>

<p>
It is a declarative way (using the power of Nix DSL compared to using
series commands in YAML file) to deterministically reproduce layered
Docker image that saves time and money in your DevOps journey. Have
fun and enjoy!

<p>
After reading a Google blog post on Bard's increasing ability for
reasoning about source code, I thought I would give it a try. The
issue is that not like OpenAI, Bard currently does not have an http
API that I can use via curl. I googled around and came across the
`bard-rs` project here: <a href="https://github.com/Alfex4936/Bard-rs">https://github.com/Alfex4936/Bard-rs</a>. So I
followed the excellent instruction to get set up using bard from
command line and its is pretty solid. I used following Elisp to use
`bard-rs` from Emacs' compilation buffer here:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<p>
1913 Webster dictionary gives following definition to Artificial Intelligence:
<b>Artificial</b> - 1. Made or contrived by art; produced or modified by
human skill and labor, in opposition to natural; 2. Feigned;
fictitious; assumed; affected; not genuine. 3. Artful; cunning;
crafty. 4. Cultivated; not indigenous; not of spontaneous growth;
<b>Intelligence</b> - 1. The act or state of knowing; the exercise of the
understanding. 2. The capacity to know or understand; readiness of
comprehension; the intellect, as a gift or an endowment. 3. Knowledge
imparted or acquired, whether by study, research, or experience;
general information. Specifically; (Mil.) Information about an enemy
or potential enemy, his capacities, and intentions.
</p>

<p>
Let us read and re-read above definitions and give it a few minutes to
sink in. With our skilled labor, we have managed to produce a very
powerful fictitious software that can understand, produce and reason
about human generated artifacts such as language, images and
videos. Our ability to make it more scalable, more accurate and more
controllable is just a matter of time considering what we have is
already pretty powerful enough. My following interaction with ChatGPT
3.5 is already impressive:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">[ME]: Explain, then add tests and simplify if possible:
(defun kprompt (&amp;optional p)
  (interactive "P")
  (let* ((bname (if p "*org-ai-on-region*" "*scratch*"))
         (directive "Explain, then add tests and simplify if possible:\n")
         (prompt (if p
                     (buffer-substring (region-beginning) (region-end))
                   (read-string "AI Chat Prompt: "))))
    (with-current-buffer (pop-to-buffer bname)
      (when p
        (erase-buffer)
        (org-mode)
        (setq truncate-lines nil)
        (setq word-wrap t)
        (org-ai--insert-created-timestamp)
        (insert "\n")
        (insert "#+begin_ai\n" "[ME]: " directive prompt "\n" "#+end_ai\n")
        (forward-line -1)
        (org-ai-complete-block))
      (when (not p)
        (beginning-of-buffer)
        (open-line 2)
        (org-ai-prompt prompt)))))

[AI]: This function takes an optional argument, p, which determines whether the user
will be prompted to enter a text or whether the function will use the text highlighted
in the buffer. 

If p is provided, it will create a new buffer with the name "*org-ai-on-region*" and
insert the highlighted text from the current buffer along with a directive. This new
buffer buffer will be formatted using org-mode to allow for better organization of
comprehension text. Finally, it will call org-ai-complete-block to add some
AI-generated text to the prompt.

If p is not provided, it will prompt the user to enter text and then call
org-ai-prompt org-ai-prompt to add some AI-generated text to the prompt.

Tests:

Input:
(kprompt)
Expected Output:
AI Chat Prompt: 

Input:
(kprompt t)
Expected Output:
*org-ai-on-region* buffer created with prompt

Input:
(Highlight "This is a test")
(kprompt t)
Expected output:
*org-ai-on-region* buffer created with "This is a test" text and AI-generated text.

Simplified Code:
The code appears to be relatively straightforward and efficient.
No simplification is needed.

</div>

<p>
It understood and reasoned about a piece of code (simple for now but
does not matter as it can get pretty powerful in no time) despite the
fact that it has never seen above code before in its entirety (I am
pretty sure about that since it is a private code and this is the only
time I am making the code public). This degree of intelligence
codified into a software that a few powerful cooperation currently
dominates should be something that keeps every software engineers
awake at night. Not because of its inherent danger or tremendous
productivity boosting ability as folks on the opposite side of
spectrum of current AI debate claimed, but because of the very fact
that every aspect of human lives will be effected by a such a
powerful code like ChatGPT whether we like it or not, and we need
to do whatever we can to ensure it is used for the good of humanity in
general. It is created by humans and should serve humans. Make no
mistake about it. Powerful software systems like that is already used
by big cooperations and rouge states to cajole people into a state of
self censorship if not into a state of heedlessness of its future
implication. Social media, powerful tracking and image recognition
systems are already pervasive in the lives of millions of people that
are being controlled by dictators all around the world (and it is
being exported very actively in the name of economic progress) to
socially engineer people's behaviors that benefits their agenda in
the name of social and economic progress at the very expense of
destroying anyone or anything that is deemed as an obstacle.
</p>

<p>
As a software engineer who have seen the worst of what bad actors can
do with such a powerful systems, I am calling out to all of my fellow
engineers to start thinking about what kind of world we would like our
kids to inherit from us regardless of where you are, who you are and
what is your geopolitical affiliation is. The wave is already there,
and it takes all of us to make sure we are not being social
engineered out of our humanity. I believe in the power of our humanity
to make AI to work for us not the other way around. I registered the
domain <b>www.codeforhumanrights.org</b> few years ago and this might be a
good time to start putting it to a good use. If you are reading this

<p>
Code complexity is something we all deal with in our daily work. There
are many tools to helps us manage it. One of the most important one is
to make incremental changes where each change is about <b>one and one
context alone</b> , which is a great definition of <b>an atomic commit</b>. I
do not think I need to convince you about its benefits any further
than what I already have alluded to above, which is worth repeating
here: It helps us contain complexity within our code base. In pursuit
of making it easy for me to do atomic commits, I settled down
following workflow:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Separate changes by its effects. If a change is immutable, that is
to say it is simple refactor or restructure that does not change the
existing behavior, it should be in one commit.</li>
<li>If changes are mutable, that is to say it changes existing behavior,
group them further by their logical context where the context is
about one and one thing alone. This is really crucial since we would
like to make sure every commit can stand on its own and does not
depend on later commits. This gives us the linear append only change
that we can easily keep track of. This might sound a bit strange to
you, but it means that you should not commit a not finished work at
least not push up stream. That also does not mean that you should
not commit your work as often as possible but if you do commit and
end up violating above convention, you should amend/squash your
commits.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Having armed with above convention, I incorporated following tools to
help me to make atomic commits easy:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/"><b>Emacs</b></a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/oneness/commit-patch"><b>commit-patch</b></a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/oneness/commit-patch/blob/master/commit-patch-buffer.el"><b>commit-patch-buffer</b></a></li>
</ul>

<p>
I am not going to repeat what the excellent <a href="https://porkrind.org/missives/commit-patch-managing-your-mess">blog</a> talked about above
tools here, but it is worth checking it out, and I highly recommend
it. If you happen to use Emacs, here is how you add it to your
config:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">
;; clone above repo in to ~/repos and eval following code
(load-file "~/repos/commit-patch/commit-patch-buffer.el")
(eval-after-load 'diff-mode
  '(require 'commit-patch-buffer nil 'noerror))

</pre>
</div>

<p>
With above configuration, you can M-x vc-diff a file (vc-root-diff for
whole project) then kill, split or edit the resulting hunks using diff
mode's built-in commands and to then hit C-c C-c to commit the
patch. Later if you realized that your commit is not atomic, you can
make further changes and amend previous commit by C-c C-C (note the
upper case C).

<p>
StrangeLoop this year made me feel almost as normal as those during
pre pandemic times especially in terms of size of participants and
sponsors. I actually believe it had the most sponsorship so far among
those I attended over the years. One noticeable company was AWS that a
friend of mine joined earlier this year. So it was pretty exciting to
meet up with him there. As always, the breadths of folks and topics
from all walks of Software Engineering is just excellent this time as
well. I took few notes on the talks that I am able to attend and would
summarize them on few categories below.
</p>

<p>
<b>Dev Experience</b> : I consider observability to be an important part of
 development experience, which is always pushed back as an
 afterthought for almost all the startups that I worked with and I
 know of. The talk "Building Observability for 99% Developers" by Jean
 Yang just resonated with me and I am really glad that her company is
 building tools to make developer experience better using <a href="https://ebpf.io">eBPF</a> that
 has matured in the last few years. It was quite and entertaining talk
 and I highly recommend you check it out. Another talk that I really
 enjoyed is "Workflows, a new abstraction for distributed systems" by
 Dominik Tornow. If you are dealing with the chaos of distributed
 services, the abstraction that he presented make you feel like you
 are working with monolith (oh the happy times :) again with the
 advantage of cloud scalibility.
</p>

<p>
<b>Programming Languages</b> : I personally prefer dynamic languages
 (Clojure to be exact) as my tools of choice for my day to day
 practice of solving problems for people but I do see the benefit of
 type system as a guiding rail when designing an API or better yet
 generating code. You should check out the talk "Codegen with Types,
 for Humans, by Humans" by Matthew Griffith, where he talks about how
 to use types to generate code for human consumption. If you are
 working with (or say fighting with) type system that is complecting
 your business logic/code execution, you should check out the talk
 "Monad I Love You Now Get Out Of My Type System" by Gjeta Gjyshinca,
 where she talks about the platform that helps Scala developer to get
 their type system out of business logic with just five extra
 characters, @node, with a compiler plugin.

<b>Data Centric Problem Solving</b> : Strange Loop Conf have always been
 attractive to data centric practices and paradigms and this year was
 no different. There are many talks related to how to generate,
 architect and analyze data. The talk titled "Data-driven
 investigation in defense of human rights" by Christo Buschek is
 presented with very clear and methodical approaches to solve real
 problems we face around the world. I really feel like we need more of
 that type of work where we put technology for the benefit of our
 fellow human beings. I think he should do another presentation next
 year titled "Data-driven investigation in defense of peace and
 opposition of war", which surely makes me sign up for Strange Loop
 for one last time (Next year will be the last time you can experience
 Strange Loop and I highly recommend you attend to see what you have
 been missing).
