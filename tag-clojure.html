<p>
Clojure has number special forms. Among them are <b>let</b> and
<b>binding</b> that are implemented as macros. For new comers to Clojure,
above can be confusing to understand, which I hope to address in this
blog post. If you have read "Programming Clojure" book, you might be
thinking that it is easy to use them correctly considering following
straightforward example:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-clojure">(def x 7) ;; bind the var x to the value 7
(defn print-x [x]
  (println x))

(let [x 9]
  (print-x)) ;; prints 7

(binding [x 9]
  (print-x)) ;; prints 9
</pre>
</div>
<p>
Why? Because <b>let</b> creates a lexical scoped vars, which is local to
the code block or functions where it is initially defined while <b>def</b>
creates a global var that is visible to all functions under the
namespace that you are in. Therefore, in the example above, <b>let</b> just
created a new "x" with the value of 9. But it is not local to the
function "print-x". That is to say, "print-x" have no knowledge of the
local scoped binding that is created by <b>let</b>. <b>binding</b> macro instead
creates a new binding for the already existed var, "x" with the value
of 9. Since "print-x" is evaluated within the <b>binding</b> form, the
newly bound value is visible to any chained calls within the form. All
nice and easy. However, it is not that obvious to understand and use
them correctly. Look at following example:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-clojure">(def x 7)
(def y 9)

(let [x 5 y x] y) ;; returns 5
(binding [x 5 y x] y) ;; returns 7
</pre>
</div>
<p>
<b>let</b> example is just fine. It created a new var "y" with the value of
5 bound to it. But what is going on with the <b>binding</b> example? If we
dig little deeper to Clojure API doc, we learn that the new bindings
in <b>binding</b> are made in parallel, not sequential as it is in <b>let</b>.
Therefore, existing var "y" gets bound to the root binding of "x" not
the overshadowed value of "x", which is the case in the <b>let</b> example.
OK, so far so good. Let us look at another example:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-clojure">(defn print-x [&amp; args]
  (println "print-x prints: " args))
(defn print-y [&amp; args]
  (println "print-y prints: " args))
(let [print-x print-y] (print-x 123)) ;; print-y prints: (1 2 3)
(binding [print-x print-y] (print-x 123)) ;; print-y prints: (1 2 3)
(binding [print-x print-y] #(print-x 123)) ;; prints
					     ;; cryptic "#&lt;user$eval__28$fn__30
					     ;; user$eval__28$fn__30@bdb503&gt;"
((binding [print-x print-y] #(print-x 123))) ;; print-x prints: (1 2 3)
</pre>
</div>
<p>
All the lines but the last two are pretty straight forward. But how
about the last line? Shouldn't it call "print-y" function? Not really.
It is because the anonymous function is evaluated outside of the
<b>binding</b> form. The "#&lt;user$eval_<sub>28</sub>$fn_<sub>30</sub>
user$eval_<sub>28</sub>$fn_<sub>30</sub>@bdb503&gt;" is an indication that anonymous function
did not get evaluated. The extra parens evals above form. Ok,
now, how do you make sure it evaluates within the <b>binding</b> form? Just
enclose the anonymous function within parenthesis. What do we learn
from all of the above? Here are the summary that helps one use <b>let</b>
and <b>binding</b> correctly:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Use <b>binding</b> only if you are trying to alter a behavior dynamically
for special-vars that is already defined. Enclose your special vars
within * as recommended by idiomatic clojure to make your intent
clear.</li>
<li>Use <b>let</b> for locally scoped vars and avoid shadowing already
defined vars.</li>
<li>Remember <b>let</b> binding is sequential and <b>binding</b> binding is done in parallel.</li>
<li>Pay close attention to the scope of the <b>binding</b> form. Any
expression that is not evaluated inside the form, will not see the
binding. That is to say, binding in <b>binding</b> form is thread local
starting from the <b>binding</b> form until it ends including any
expression that is chained within the form, which is what the
thread-local are all about.</li>
<li>Lastly avoid using <b>binding</b> as much as possible. I have seen many
production bugs related to issues I outlined here.</li>

<p>
I have been building systems in Clojure/ClojureScript for the the last
7 years or so. I enjoy using it to solve day to day problems. It is
still my go-to language of choice and I love the fact that it guides me
to think about problem at hand with very data centric way. As a tiny
example of this, consider a feature where you need to toggle the sort
ordering:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-clojure">(defn toggle-order [order]
  (order {:asc :desc
	  :desc :asc}))
</pre>
</div>
<p>
It is tiny but mighty. There is no if/else/case etc and it is easy to
read, which is extremely important as your program grows due to needed
complexity. Speaking of being <b>easy to read</b>, I could not help but to
quote following from SICP book:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Our design of this introductory computer-science subject reï¬‚ects two
major concerns. First, we want to establish the idea that a computer
language is not just a way of gettng a computer to perform operations
but rather that it is a novel formal medium for expressing ideas about
methodology. <b>Thus, programs must be written for people to read, and
only incidentally for machines to execute.</b> Second, we believe that
the essential material to be addressed by a subject at this level is
not the syntax of particular programming-language constructs, nor
clever algorithms for computing particular functions efficiently, nor
even the mathematical analysis of algorithms and the foundations of
computing, but rather the techniques used to control the intellectual
complexity of large software systems.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
For me, Using Clojure and Datomic professionally has been a game
changer not only in terms of being more problem solving focused but
more importantly a paradigm shift for taming domain complexity. It has
helped me deliver robust, high performance systems within time and
budget. However, having bitten by half baked distributed systems made
up of tiny services done as afterthoughts, I have always been on the
lookout for more robust distributed system development story. Then I
found <b>Elixir</b>, a functional language running on Erlang VM called
<b>BEAM</b>. After spending some time attending ElixirConf US and couple of
meetups in <b>ErlangElixirSF</b>, I am posting what I really liked about
Elixir community that Clojure Community might benefit:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Elixir community has a strong focus on few important projects in
their ecosystem, namely <b>Elixir the language and its build tool-
Mix</b>, <b>Pheonix Framework</b>, <b>Nerve</b>, <b>Ecto</b>, and <b>absinthe - The
GraphQL toolkit for Elixir</b>.</li>
<li>Elixir community is pretty mature in terms of keeping the core
language small and extensible, which is abundantly clear from the
creator of Elixir, Jose Valim's 2018 ElixirConf US keynote.</li>
<li>Elixir community is super focused on Documentation and Developer
happiness by having great tooling and convention that they all love
and agreed upon such as <b>mix format</b></li>
</ul>

<p>
I hope someone from both community find above helpful.

<div class="post-date">26 Oct 2018</div><h1 class="post-title"><a href="https://www.birkey.co/2018-10-26-datafy-and-tap>-in-clojure-1.10.html">Datafy and tap> in Clojure 1.10</a></h1>
<p>
I noticed couple of new features being added to Clojure 1.10. One is
<b>tap</b>, which is added to the core ns, and the other is <b>datafy</b>, which
is added to clojure.datafy ns.  
</p>

<p>
<b>tap</b> essentially is an atom holding set of fns of single arity, which
will be asynchronously called on any value you you send via
<b>tap&gt;</b>. You can add a single arity fn to the <b>tap</b> via <b>(add-tap f)</b>
and remove the fn via <b>(remove-tap f</b>).  Note that you have to
remember the fn you added so you can remove it. Otherwise, you have no
way of removing the fn, which is an inconvenience but there might be a
reason why it is the way it is. I am not sure about its intended use
cases but I know it comes handy when you have a set of transformation
(<b>important: order of those transformation should not matter</b>) that you
would like to apply to any value asynchronously. I can think of
following uses cases for tap:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Collecting some sort of diagnostic information about running system.</li>
<li>Streaming serious of values to be processed and routed to a sink somewhere.</li>
<li>May be used (rather abused) to execute some code? hope not.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Enough being said, let us see with a simple example to cover first
uses case I said above. 
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-clojure">(def context (StringBuilder.))

(defn -&gt;context [x]
  (doto context
    (.append x)))

;; Then let us add above fn to the tapset
(add-tap -&gt;context)
;; Then from any where of our running code, we can do:
(tap&gt; "******* tap start ********\n ")
(tap&gt; "runing.......................\n")
(tap&gt; "******* tap end **********\n ")

;; It will be executed in a separate dedicated thread and will not
;; block or interfere with our running code. Then we print out the context:
(str context)
;; which results in:
;;******* tap start ********
;; runing.......................
;;******* tap end **********

;; Remember to remove the -&gt;context fn once you are done with that session:
(remove-tap -&gt;context)
;; If there is no fn added to the tap, any values you send to tap will be discarded.
(tap&gt; "your magic") ;; your magic will be discarded.

</pre>
</div>

<p>
The other one I noticed is <b>datafy</b>, which I am more excited about. I
am already using it to find out about java classes members, methods
and its object graph. Let us take a java class <b>String</b> as an example.
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-clojure">(require '[clojure.datafy :as d])
(d/datafy String) ;; which will print all about its members in a nice clojure ds

;; let us write an fn to give use any member that we would like to find more about:
(defn member-lookup [class member]
  (-&gt;&gt; class
       d/datafy
       :members
       (filter (fn [[k v]] (= (symbol member) k)))))
;; then use it to find about "intern"
(member-lookup String "intern")
;; returns:
([intern
  [{:name intern,
    :return-type java.lang.String,
    :declaring-class java.lang.String,
    :parameter-types [],
    :exception-types [],
    :flags #{:public :native}}]])

;; One can learn a lot about this method from above ds. "intern" is a
;; public native method that takes no argument, called on string object
;; and returns string like this:
(.intern "test") ;; =&gt; "test"

</pre>
</div>

<p>
This means we can use above information to create Clojure fns on the
fly for java inter-op. One great use case would be to generate Clojure
fns out of AWS Java SDK, which I might do if time permits.

<p>
While back when I was learning Clojure, I have written a small lib
that allows me directly generate bar chart out of google search
results from Clojure. I updated it with latest deps and added a fn to
save the bar-chart to a png file. You can checkout the project here:
<a href="https://github.com/oneness/gcount">https://github.com/oneness/gcount</a>.  Here is a one liner to get you
going:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-shell">git clone git@github.com/oneness/gcount.git &amp;&amp; cd gcount &amp;&amp; lein repl
</pre>
</div>
<p>
Once you are in repl, you can type following:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-clojure">(search-view-terms ["Clojure Programming" "Elixir Programming" "Elm Programming"])
</pre>
</div>
<p>
Above will produce something like this:
