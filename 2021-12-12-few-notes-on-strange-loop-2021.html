<p>
This year's Strange Loop was my 4th and it was as good as it has been
in the past. One of the main reason I like to go to conferences
especially Strange Loop was to see beyond the state of the art
transmittable knowledge, which is the untransimittable one. In this
age of Google search, Stack Overflow copy/paste and Coding school
driven programming, which has its own place in our industry, we need
to be cognizant of the existence and importance of the
untransimittable part of software engineering knowledge that can only
be acquired by learning from the masters. And Strange Loop has never
failed me so far to provide an opportunity to jolt my brain to find
easier those tacit knowledge that otherwise might have taken me long
winding road to acquire. I would like to present few of those that I
have taken notes so it will help my aspiring fellow engineers.
</p>

<p>
<b>Domain Driven Design</b> : There are numerous books/posts/videos about
 how to do it right and I have been using it with success for the last
 few years. However, I have always been little bit unclear about how I
 measure its benefit within my engineering team. I got the `AHA`
 moment when second day keynote put up a quote on its slide stating
 that 'Small change in product (Domain), should result in small change
 in the code (implementation)'. Now, I know how to measure if we are
 doing it right or wrong in my team.
</p>

<p>
<b>API Design</b> : There is a talk about using Rust's type system in
 aiding you to design a robust API that does validation and error
 reporting right. While that talk focus on how Rust type system is
 tremendously useful to library (API) designer, what I see from that
 talk is way beyond just helpfulness of a well designed type system,
 which is a languages ability to allow you to specify your system's
 interfaces exactly as you intended. If you are not using one of those
 languages (Rust, F#, Ada and Clojure &#x2026; any language that allows you
 specify interfaces) in your library/API work, you should be checking
 them out to see what you are missing (also remember to keep an eye
 for what you are loosing. It is all about trade offs).
</p>

<p>
<b>Dependencies</b> : This is a topic that is very dear to day to day
 practice considering my current preferred tool of choice (Clojure and
 ClojureScript). The branchstack talk triggered sort of `AHA` moment
 for me in treating the entire state of your system (code) vs the
 state of your outside dependencies. I'd like to think of them as your
 internal state vs external state. I have been advocating and
 practicing a sort of convention your system should only be just three steps
 away from being able to be worked upon, which is:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-shell">git clone &lt;your_system_x&gt; &amp;&amp; make deps &amp;&amp; make run
</pre>
</div>
<p>
Note that it does not have to be git and make. Any tool of your
choice will do. The idea is that as a project owner, it is your
responsibility to make sure that your system workflow is easily
reproducible and those tools should be treated as first class citizen
as your system logic code.
</p>

<p>
Again, those kind of tacit knowledge can only be learned by being in
the presence of crafts people and having actually conversation with
them in close vicinity. I have enjoyed all the talks that I attended
and even more so the hallway and lunch table conversation. And I am
looking forward to Strange Loop 2022 already :).
