<p>  I enjoy engineering information systems optimized for end user and
developer productivity, which can only be achieved by being vigilant
about keeping IT as simple as IT possibly can be. If you are into
Clojure, F# or other Programming Languages that I should check
out, drop me a line via ktuman at acm dot org.

<p>
A web application tinkerer deals with malformed inputs, faulty
networks, buggy software and everything in between. One tool that
saved the day on more than one occasion is: <b>cURL</b>, which should be
under every engineers' arsenal. Following are two examples how it
proved to be just the right tool to reach for.
</p>

<p>
Among many micro services writtent in Clojure, one of them exposed
following logic via a REST API:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Take a shortened URL, expand it to find the actual
URL it is pointing to, and parse URL param to generate a JSON object
of k/v to return to the caller.</li>
</ul>

<p>
One of our client reported a bug where their Ad data dashboard did not
show up one day. Looking at the log trace, I realized that above
service might be failing. I had a choice of starting a full suite of
our services to reproduce it or just using cURL from the terminal to
find out what the Ad URL expanded to. Here is an example:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-bash">curl -ILs https://bit.ly/2MSn9Xm
</pre>
</div>
<p>
Following is the output:
</p>

The options <b>-ILs</b> tells cURL to query resource headers with location
information in silent mode. After seeing the location information of
the client's Ad URL, I was able to pinpoint the missing url param from
the source data that our client is expecting. Once I informed this
info to our client, they are able to fix their own issue with grace.
</p>

<p>
Second time cURL came to the rescue is when a developer from
my team reached out to me for a mysterious bug he was experiencing. An
API call was failing for 50% of the time with truncated response that
was causing error on his application. Not knowing anything about the
application much, I asked him to call the API using cURL to eliminate
the possibility of OS network related issues. Once I know that the API
work is working 100% of the time via cURL, I narrowed the issues down
to the application code. The application is written in Node and
following are abbreviated version of how the JS code looks like:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-javascript">function getFoo(){
  return axios.get(urlFoo)
}

function getBar(url){
  return axios.get(url)
}

function getFooBar(){
 var foo = getFoo(); //block until we have a result
 // this line below was failing due to malformed foo becuase it is truncated
 var url = "magicUrl" //parse `foo`, construct url
 var bar = getBar(url)
 return parse(bar)
}

</pre>
</div>
<p>
My teammate said that he did try increasing the timeout of the `axios`
library but it did not help. I asked him to see if `axios` have
some configuration setting related to buffer size or connection, and he
confirmed that it does have `connection reuse` setting where it is
default value are `false`. I asked him to try setting it to `true`,
which he did and voila, API call went through with 100% success
rate. Now, our problem is solved and we can move on with our
lives.
</p>

<p>
I just want to convince you how usefull <b>cURL</b> command is and you
should use it whenever you can. I might write a post in the future on
why the response was getting truncated and why reusing the connection
helped solve the issue.
