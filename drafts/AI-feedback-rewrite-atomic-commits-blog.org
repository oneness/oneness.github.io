This essay is relatively close to an ideal PTE essay. However, there
are a few areas of improvement that could be addressed to make it even
better.

First, there are a few grammar and punctuation issues that should be
addressed. For example, the sentence "If changes are mutable, that is
to say it changes existing behavior, group them further by their
logical context where the context is about one and one thing alone"
could be rephrased to "If changes are mutable, meaning they change
existing behavior, group them further by their logical context, which
should be about one thing alone".

Second, the essay could benefit from some more specific language. For
example, instead of saying "This is really crucial" it would be better
to say "This is essential" or "This is absolutely vital".

Third, the essay could be made more cohesive with transitions between
sentences and paragraphs. For example, a transition sentence such as
"Having armed with these conventions, I incorporated the following
tools to help make atomic commits easy" could be added between the
discussion on conventions and the mention of the tools.

Lastly, the essay could be made more concise by eliminating small
phrases that don't add much to the overall essay. For example, the
phrase "I do not think I need to convince you about its benefits any
further than what I already have alluded to above" could be removed or
reduced to a single word, such as "benefits".

Making these improvements would greatly enhance the essay and make it
more suitable for the PTE exam.

With the advent of technology, our lives are becoming more useful and
interesting than ever before. From a time where our everyday
activities are done manually to a time where much of these can be
automated with the help of technology, it is evident that
technological advancement has had a profound impact on our lives. In
this essay, I will discuss and explain why technology has allowed us
to have a more useful and interesting life than in the past.

First, technology has allowed us to gain access to convenient,
efficient, and cost-effective services. For instance, online shopping,
banking services, and telemedicine have made our daily lives easier
and more convenient as we no longer need to be physically present to
avail of these services. Moreover, technology has allowed us to stay
connected with the world. Platforms like social media have enabled us
to build our own community and stay in touch with people we care
about, thus leading to more interesting lives.

Second, technology has lifted the limits of our creativity and
imagination. Artificial intelligence and robotics have revolutionized
the way we traditionally think and approach problems. Now, by
incorporating these technologies into our lives, we can come up with
innovative solutions that can significantly improve our quality of
life in society. For example, renewable energy is a technology that
has already helped us reduce our carbon footprint and address global
warming issues.

To conclude, technology has enabled us to have a more useful and
interesting life than in the past by providing us access to
convenient, efficient, and cost-effective services, and lifting the
limits of our creativity and imagination. Through technology we can
harness the power of the digital revolution for a better tomorrow.
