<p>
After reading a Google blog post on Bard's increasing ability for
reasoning about source code, I thought I would give it a try. The
issue is that not like OpenAI, Bard currently does not have an http
API that I can use via curl. I googled around and came across the
`bard-rs` project here: <a href="https://github.com/Alfex4936/Bard-rs">https://github.com/Alfex4936/Bard-rs</a>. So I
followed the excellent instruction to get set up using bard from
command line and its is pretty solid. I used following Elisp to use
`bard-rs` from Emacs' compilation buffer here:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(defun kcompilation-start (cmd name &amp;optional mode)
  (let* ((compile-command nil)
         (compilation-save-buffers-predicate 'ignore)
         (compilation-buffer
          (compilation-start cmd
                             (if (equal mode 'read-only) nil t)
                             (lambda (m)
                               (or (when (boundp 'name)
                                     (format "*%s*" name))
                                   (buffer-name))))))
    (when current-prefix-arg
      (with-current-buffer compilation-buffer
        (switch-to-prev-buffer (get-buffer-window (current-buffer)))))
    (message (format "Running %s in %s ..." cmd name))))

(defun kprompt-bard (&amp;optional p)
  "Prompts for input to send it to `bard` using `bard-rs` in
*bard-prompt* buffer. If mark-active, uses the text in the region
 as the prompt"
  (interactive "P")
  (let* ((bs "bard-prompt")
         (bname (format "*%s*" bs))
         (bname (if (get-buffer bname)
                    bname
                  (progn (kcompilation-start "bard-rs -e ~/.env" bs)
                         bname)))
         (prompt (if mark-active
                     (replace-regexp-in-string
                      "\n"
                      ""
                      (buffer-substring-no-properties (region-beginning) (region-end)))
                   (read-string "AI Chat Prompt: "))))
    (with-current-buffer (pop-to-buffer bname)
      (when p
        (end-of-buffer)
        (insert "!reset")
        (comint-send-input)
        (end-of-buffer)
        (insert prompt)
        (comint-send-input))
      (when (not p)
        (end-of-buffer)
        (insert prompt)
        (comint-send-input)))))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
You can bind `kprompt-bard` to any key of your choice and start
interacting with Google bard from the comfort of Emacs' buffer.

<p>
1913 Webster dictionary gives following definition to Artificial Intelligence:
<b>Artificial</b> - 1. Made or contrived by art; produced or modified by
human skill and labor, in opposition to natural; 2. Feigned;
fictitious; assumed; affected; not genuine. 3. Artful; cunning;
crafty. 4. Cultivated; not indigenous; not of spontaneous growth;
<b>Intelligence</b> - 1. The act or state of knowing; the exercise of the
understanding. 2. The capacity to know or understand; readiness of
comprehension; the intellect, as a gift or an endowment. 3. Knowledge
imparted or acquired, whether by study, research, or experience;
general information. Specifically; (Mil.) Information about an enemy
or potential enemy, his capacities, and intentions.
</p>

<p>
Let us read and re-read above definitions and give it a few minutes to
sink in. With our skilled labor, we have managed to produce a very
powerful fictitious software that can understand, produce and reason
about human generated artifacts such as language, images and
videos. Our ability to make it more scalable, more accurate and more
controllable is just a matter of time considering what we have is
already pretty powerful enough. My following interaction with ChatGPT
3.5 is already impressive:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">[ME]: Explain, then add tests and simplify if possible:
(defun kprompt (&amp;optional p)
  (interactive "P")
  (let* ((bname (if p "*org-ai-on-region*" "*scratch*"))
         (directive "Explain, then add tests and simplify if possible:\n")
         (prompt (if p
                     (buffer-substring (region-beginning) (region-end))
                   (read-string "AI Chat Prompt: "))))
    (with-current-buffer (pop-to-buffer bname)
      (when p
        (erase-buffer)
        (org-mode)
        (setq truncate-lines nil)
        (setq word-wrap t)
        (org-ai--insert-created-timestamp)
        (insert "\n")
        (insert "#+begin_ai\n" "[ME]: " directive prompt "\n" "#+end_ai\n")
        (forward-line -1)
        (org-ai-complete-block))
      (when (not p)
        (beginning-of-buffer)
        (open-line 2)
        (org-ai-prompt prompt)))))

[AI]: This function takes an optional argument, p, which determines whether the user
will be prompted to enter a text or whether the function will use the text highlighted
in the buffer. 

If p is provided, it will create a new buffer with the name "*org-ai-on-region*" and
insert the highlighted text from the current buffer along with a directive. This new
buffer buffer will be formatted using org-mode to allow for better organization of
comprehension text. Finally, it will call org-ai-complete-block to add some
AI-generated text to the prompt.

If p is not provided, it will prompt the user to enter text and then call
org-ai-prompt org-ai-prompt to add some AI-generated text to the prompt.

Tests:

Input:
(kprompt)
Expected Output:
AI Chat Prompt: 

Input:
(kprompt t)
Expected Output:
*org-ai-on-region* buffer created with prompt

Input:
(Highlight "This is a test")
(kprompt t)
Expected output:
*org-ai-on-region* buffer created with "This is a test" text and AI-generated text.

Simplified Code:
The code appears to be relatively straightforward and efficient.
No simplification is needed.

<p>
It understood and reasoned about a piece of code (simple for now but
does not matter as it can get pretty powerful in no time) despite the
fact that it has never seen above code before in its entirety (I am
pretty sure about that since it is a private code and this is the only
time I am making the code public). This degree of intelligence
codified into a software that a few powerful cooperation currently
dominates should be something that keeps every software engineers
awake at night. Not because of its inherent danger or tremendous
productivity boosting ability as folks on the opposite side of
spectrum of current AI debate claimed, but because of the very fact
that every aspect of human lives will be effected by a such a
powerful code like ChatGPT whether we like it or not, and we need
to do whatever we can to ensure it is used for the good of humanity in
general. It is created by humans and should serve humans. Make no
mistake about it. Powerful software systems like that is already used
by big cooperations and rouge states to cajole people into a state of
self censorship if not into a state of heedlessness of its future
implication. Social media, powerful tracking and image recognition
systems are already pervasive in the lives of millions of people that
are being controlled by dictators all around the world (and it is
being exported very actively in the name of economic progress) to
socially engineer people's behaviors that benefits their agenda in
the name of social and economic progress at the very expense of
destroying anyone or anything that is deemed as an obstacle.
</p>

<p>
As a software engineer who have seen the worst of what bad actors can
do with such a powerful systems, I am calling out to all of my fellow
engineers to start thinking about what kind of world we would like our
kids to inherit from us regardless of where you are, who you are and
what is your geopolitical affiliation is. The wave is already there,
and it takes all of us to make sure we are not being social
engineered out of our humanity. I believe in the power of our humanity
to make AI to work for us not the other way around. I registered the
domain <b>www.codeforhumanrights.org</b> few years ago and this might be a
good time to start putting it to a good use. If you are reading this

<p>
Code complexity is something we all deal with in our daily work. There
are many tools to helps us manage it. One of the most important one is
to make incremental changes where each change is about <b>one and one
context alone</b> , which is a great definition of <b>an atomic commit</b>. I
do not think I need to convince you about its benefits any further
than what I already have alluded to above, which is worth repeating
here: It helps us contain complexity within our code base. In pursuit
of making it easy for me to do atomic commits, I settled down
following workflow:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Separate changes by its effects. If a change is immutable, that is
to say it is simple refactor or restructure that does not change the
existing behavior, it should be in one commit.</li>
<li>If changes are mutable, that is to say it changes existing behavior,
group them further by their logical context where the context is
about one and one thing alone. This is really crucial since we would
like to make sure every commit can stand on its own and does not
depend on later commits. This gives us the linear append only change
that we can easily keep track of. This might sound a bit strange to
you, but it means that you should not commit a not finished work at
least not push up stream. That also does not mean that you should
not commit your work as often as possible but if you do commit and
end up violating above convention, you should amend/squash your
commits.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Having armed with above convention, I incorporated following tools to
help me to make atomic commits easy:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/"><b>Emacs</b></a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/oneness/commit-patch"><b>commit-patch</b></a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/oneness/commit-patch/blob/master/commit-patch-buffer.el"><b>commit-patch-buffer</b></a></li>
</ul>

<p>
I am not going to repeat what the excellent <a href="https://porkrind.org/missives/commit-patch-managing-your-mess">blog</a> talked about above
tools here, but it is worth checking it out, and I highly recommend
it. If you happen to use Emacs, here is how you add it to your
config:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">
;; clone above repo in to ~/repos and eval following code
(load-file "~/repos/commit-patch/commit-patch-buffer.el")
(eval-after-load 'diff-mode
  '(require 'commit-patch-buffer nil 'noerror))

</pre>
</div>

<p>
With above configuration, you can M-x vc-diff a file (vc-root-diff for
whole project) then kill, split or edit the resulting hunks using diff
mode's built-in commands and to then hit C-c C-c to commit the
patch. Later if you realized that your commit is not atomic, you can
make further changes and amend previous commit by C-c C-C (note the
upper case C).

<p>
One of the feature of Eshell that took me sometime to really
appreciate is its built-in ability to emulate Plan9 smart Shell. It
allows you to run a script or a command, run it again by just hitting
enter key after you modify it, say you made a mistake or want to
change part of it using Emacs editing power. You might say that you
can do same thing in any terminal using your up arrow key and command
line editing. But I challenge you to try it until you fully realize
the advantage you have vs regular terminal. Below is a simple screen
recording to show you what I mean:

I recommend you read following post to learn more about smart shell
and more about eshell including aliases:

Since eshell buffer is just a regular emacs buffer, we have all of the
emacs power at our disposal. In part 3 of my post, I briefly alluded
to multiple terminal management by just using few lines of elisp and
all without using any third party packages. I am posting the main elisp
function for posterity here:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(defun krun (cmd)
  (interactive
   (list
    (ido-completing-read
     "Enter cmd to run (append ##name for buffer name): "
     (let ((history nil))
       ;; We have to build up a list ourselves from the ring vector.
       (dotimes (index (ring-length keshell-history-global-ring))
	 (push (ring-ref keshell-history-global-ring index) history))
       ;; Show them most-recent-first.
       (setq history (nreverse history))))))
  (let* ((cmds (split-string cmd "##"))
	 (tag (or (-&gt; cmds second)
		  "kshell"))
	 (buff-name (-&gt; tag s-chomp s-trim)))
    (kshell cmd buff-name)))
</pre>
</div>
<p>
The above function (along with those from the previous post) will
allow you to do following:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Start a new shell with a specific name by just appending
##buffer-name after the command</li>
<li>Run a command from history or new command in a dedicated eshell
buffer, which defaults to <b>kshell</b>. You can override as any name you
want.</li>
<li>Use all hotkeys, interactive lisp functions as you would for regular
emacs buffer. For example, you can do buffer switching, ibuffer
management, isearch, protect a buffer from being killed, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Following demonstrates above cases I am talking about:

<p>
If you have been following my `Why Eshell` series, you might be
wondering about interactive ido completion for eshell. Since Eshell
buffer is just a regular emacs buffer, we can compose few emacs
builtin functionalities to bend it to our command line work flow.
Following is all the code you need. Note that it is heavily commented
so you can understand what is happening.
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(defun kshell-with-name (&amp;optional name)
  ;; creates an eshell buffer with `kshell' as the default name. Take
  ;; optional name to override
  (let ((m (-&gt;&gt; (or name "kshell")
		(format "*%s*"))))
    (if (get-buffer m)
	(pop-to-buffer m)
      (progn
	(eshell)
	(rename-buffer m)))))

(defun kshell (&amp;optional cmd buff-name send-input)
  ;; interactive fn that you can call via M-x or hotkey. It detects
  ;; current project root to start eshell buffer if no `buff-name' is
  ;; given. You can control how the `cmd` gets insert only or insert
  ;; and executed using `send-input` flag. Ex. Useful for further
  ;; editing.
  (interactive)
  (let ((dir (projectile-project-root))) ;; you need projectile
    (if buff-name
	(kshell-with-name buff-name)
      (kshell-with-name))
    (eshell/clear-scrollback)
    (insert (format "cd %s" (or dir "~/")))
    (eshell-send-input)
    (insert (format "%s" cmd))
    (when send-input (eshell-send-input))))

(defun krun (cmd)
  ;; eshell command history with ido completion. Assign it to a hot
  ;; key say, F12 and you will get a search-able command history that
  ;; you can execute just by doing ido interactive search.
  (interactive
   (list
    (ido-completing-read
     "Enter cmd to run (append ##name for buffer name): "
     (let ((history nil))
       ;; We have to build up a list ourselves from the ring vector.
       (dotimes (index (ring-length keshell-history-global-ring))
	 (push (ring-ref keshell-history-global-ring index) history))
       ;; Show them most-recent-first.
       (setq history (nreverse history))))))
  (let* ((cmds (split-string cmd "##")) ;; you need s.el lib
	 (tag (or (-&gt; cmds second)
		  "kshell"))
	 (buff-name (-&gt; tag s-chomp s-trim)))
    (kshell cmd buff-name)))
</pre>
</div>
<p>
Here is the screen recording in action:

</figure>

<p>
I am using F12 to invoke `krun` and my cross session eshell history
shows up in the minibuffer where I can use ido completion to select a
command that I can run. As an added benefit, above code allows one to
bring a eshell buffer with specific name by adding ##name at the end
of the command if one wants to have the command run in a dedicated
buffer.

<p>
Among many reasons of why I use eshell as my main terminal, I listed
following in part 1 of my `Why Eshell?` series blog post. I am listing
it here for posterity:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><b>Long running command notification and time</b></li>
<li><b>Cross session history</b></li>
<li><b>Interactive ido completion</b></li>
<li><b>Unified interface (shell prompt buffer as regular emacs buffer)</b></li>
<li><b>Plan9 Style Shell prompt (Think of it as bash REPL)</b></li>
<li><b>Multiple terminal management</b></li>
<li><b>Super charge bash with elisp</b></li>
<li><b>Eshell aliases that puts bash aliases to shame :)</b></li>
</ol>
<p>
I addressed first point here: <a href="https://www.birkey.co/2021-06-20-why-eshell-part-1.html">notification and time</a>. Let me address
second point, which is sharing eshell history across many terminal
sessions.
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-elisp">(defvar keshell-history-global-ring nil
  "The history ring shared across Eshell sessions.")

(defun keshell-hist-use-global-history ()
  "Make Eshell history shared across different sessions."
  (unless keshell-history-global-ring
    (when eshell-history-file-name
      (eshell-read-history nil t))
    (setq keshell-history-global-ring
	  (or eshell-history-ring (make-ring eshell-history-size))))
  (setq eshell-history-ring keshell-history-global-ring))
;; Following hook enables it
(add-hook 'eshell-mode-hook 'keshell-hist-use-global-history)
;; Following removes the hook
(remove-hook 'eshell-mode-hook 'keshell-hist-use-global-history)
</pre>
</div>
<p>
After evaluating above 12 lines of elisp, you will have a list that
holds all the eshell entries across sessions, which you can persist
into a history file (just uses bash history file) and can even share
it across machines over network. This opens up a whole new
possibilities of completions, deduplication and multiple eshell
buffer management goodness, which I will cover in the next few parts
of `Why Eshell?` posts. So stay tuned and happy eshelling!

From time to time, I got asked why I use eshell as my main terminal.
There are multiple reasons I do so and covering all of them in one
post would be too long. Instead, I would like to start with a high
level bullet points and address each one in a separate blog post with
working code examples where I can point my coworkers and friends to
them so they can pick and choose as they wish.
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><b>Long running command notification and time</b></li>
<li><b>Cross session history</b></li>
<li><b>Interactive ido completion</b></li>
<li><b>Unified interface (shell prompt buffer as regular emacs buffer)</b></li>
<li><b>Plan9 Style Shell prompt (Think of it as bash REPL)</b></li>
<li><b>Multiple terminal management</b></li>
<li><b>Super charge bash with elisp</b></li>
<li><b>Eshell aliases that puts bash aliases to shame :)</b></li>
</ol>
<p>
Let us start with how you can accomplish the first item from the list
above. Following 18 lines of elisp will give you the super power of:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>How long a command took to run as if you typed in <b>time &lt;command&gt;</b></li>
<li>Notify you that the long running command finished in x second even
if you switch away from Emacs saving you the trouble of constantly
checking back. As a bonus, you can set the notification threshold
for long running commands that you want to run async.</li>
</ul>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-elisp">;; eshell time and notification
(defvar-local eshell-current-command-start-time nil)

(defun eshell-current-command-start ()
  (setq eshell-current-command-start-time (current-time)))

(defun eshell-current-command-stop ()
  (when eshell-current-command-start-time
    (let ((elapsed-time (float-time
			 (time-subtract (current-time)
					eshell-current-command-start-time))))
      (if (&gt; elapsed-time 30)
	  (tooltip-show (format "Finished in: %.0fs" elapsed-time))
	(eshell-interactive-print
	 (format "Time: %.0fs\n" elapsed-time))))
    (setq eshell-current-command-start-time nil)))

(defun eshell-current-command-time-track ()
  (add-hook 'eshell-pre-command-hook #'eshell-current-command-start nil t)
  (add-hook 'eshell-post-command-hook #'eshell-current-command-stop nil t))

;; This line below installs time tracking and notification
(add-hook 'eshell-mode-hook #'eshell-current-command-time-track)
;; Once you eval above snippet in emacs, fire up M-x eshell, and type:
sleep 40
;; You can switch away from emacs and will be notified that above
;; command took 40s to run
;; To uninstall
;; (remove-hook 'eshell-mode-hook #'eshell-current-command-time-track)
</pre>
</div>
<p>
Try doing above with some bashrc voodoo or plug-in that you have no
control over. I have been there and done that and it is one of many
reasons why I use eshell now. I hope someone finds it useful to his or
her command line work flow. Happy eshelling!

<p>
I have been thinking about writing up my experience of using Emacs and
its positive influence on me as a Software Craftsman over the last 10
years or so. Over the weekend, I came across a a blog post by the CTO
of a company, who put it very well that have really resonated with
me. It is a great read, not too long not too short, that I strongly
recommend you go ahead read and come back here to continue with the
rest of what I had to say. Here is the link: <a href="https://www.fugue.co/blog/2018-08-09-two-years-with-emacs-as-a-cto.html">Two Years With Emacs as a
CEO (and now CTO)</a>. 
</p>

<p>
So I am not going to repeat what he said about Emacs and why he still
loves to use it to get things done. I am going to add following points
on top of what he wrote there:
</p>
<div id="outline-container-orgba850c8" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgba850c8">Emacs is a great workbench</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgba850c8">
<p>
I see Emacs as an extremely well designed workbench that will evolve
with you as your work environment, technology and paradigms
change. Emacs is a live programming environment where you can change
every aspects of its functionalities, be it a simple text editing to a
complex work flow where you can interact with many external
systems. One of a startup that I worked had a mode where we have
interacted with our live system written in Clojure via its CLI
interface using `comint-mode`, which you should really checkout if you
are not familiar with it. You can use Emacs as the client with uniform
interface to many of the CLI, API and even for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_binary_interface">ABI</a>. For example `EXWM`,
which is an Window Manager, is a great example.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orge8be3a5" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orge8be3a5">Emacs is a great structured and unstructured text manipulation library</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orge8be3a5">
<p>
This is what I personally like a lot about Emacs. As a programmer, we
work with manipulating text all the time. Yes, there are great text
Editors out there, which by the way I have used all of them myself
before seeing the light of using Emacs. But I see all other
editors/IDEs as a framework for the things they set out to do rather
than a library that I can compose to solve a particular problem at
hand. For example, I can use `smartparens` package for structured text
editing of Clojure code.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org9296094" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org9296094">Emacs helps you focus</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org9296094">
<p>
In this day of our age where everything tries to grab your constant
attention, Emacs stands out as the most distraction free environment
to be in. One might argue that Emacs user spends way more time
configuration management, which is definitely true when you are just
getting started with any new toolbox, I found I spend very little time
with configuration or keeping it up to date. Once you are familiar with
Emacs help system and built in Documentation, You can be pretty much
on your own when it comes to how much you spend on customization. It
is this freedom you get from using Emacs where you are in charge as to
how much customization you would like. The reason I say Emacs helps
you focus is due to the fact that you have the freedom to make it an
distraction free writing/coding/communication environment to get done
what matters the most to you and have a lot of fun along the way.

<div id="outline-container-org3a474d0" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org3a474d0">Emacs has a learning curve</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org3a474d0">
<p>
Yes, I do acknowledge that Emacs has a learning curve. However, most
of it is due to the wrong approach we tend to take when encountering an
unknown. On hindsight, I wish I had following approach, which I do now
all the time:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Start with getting familiar with Emacs terminology such as windows,
buffers and frames etc. The builtin documentation is great for that
and it is just C-h i (Hit Control and letter `h` at the same time,
then hit `i`, which stands for info). To read Emacs' manual just
enter `m` and select `Emacs` from minibuffer. Hmm, you might be
wondering what is minibuffer, let us use this approach to find
out. Press following C-h i m key sequence and type `Minibuffer` and
hit enter. Voila, you are reading all about `Minibuffer` from the
official Emacs manual. No other application that I have used comes
close to the level of Emacs in terms of self documentation.</li>
<li>Start with the goal of getting something done. I have two example
that every programmer will benefit from learning: `Magit` and
`Org-mode`. While you need to install `magit-mode`, which is a
Emacs interface to git CLI, `org-mode` is built in. You will be
surprised to find that it makes your git journey so much fun or
your note organization so much enjoyable. I made the mistake of
trying to memorize hot keys as much as I can before learning the
hard truth of learning one key at a time as needed bases. I
strongly recommend the only hot key you need at the beginning is
`M-x`, where you just type a command so Emacs can execute for
you. For Example, if you would like open (it is `visit` in Emacs
speak) a file, just type `M-x` and type `file` then press tab key,
select `find-file` in the completion buffer, now you can choose a
file name from within the directory that you are in. It is just an
example but knowing the fact that every action you perform in Emacs
invokes an command, which is just an elisp function, is a very
powerful realization. That means you can write an elisp function to
have Emacs do whatever you like. You can also lookup what a command
does using C-h f, then typing the name of the command. For example,
C-h f then, type `org-insert-link` then enter and read on&#x2026;</li>
<li>I advise against starting with Emacs using other's configuration
including Emacs that comes with pre-configuration. As I have
mentioned earlier, Emacs is a great library where you can pick and
choose to fit your work style. You will loose this great aspects if
you start with other's way of configuring/composing it. If you had
to just start with a minimal config, put this in your `init.el`
file and start changing/adding/organizing configs as you see
fit. For example:</li>
</ol>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">;; Emacs reads init.el file located in ~/.emacs.d at startup
;; bootstrap el-get
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/el-get/el-get")
(unless (require 'el-get nil 'noerror)
  (with-current-buffer
      (url-retrieve-synchronously
       "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dimitri/el-get/master/el-get-install.el")
    (goto-char (point-max))
    (eval-print-last-sexp)))

;; Initialize available packages first
(package-refresh-contents t)

;; The only package you need to get started
(el-get-bundle smex
  (progn
    (require 'smex)
    (global-set-key (kbd "M-x") 'smex)))
</pre>
</div>
<p>
Above snippets sets you up to use `El-get`, a great package manager
that I came to rely over the years and have never failed me. It also
pulls in the only package you had to have before getting started,
`smex` that makes the only command `M-x` you need much more
intuitive. Then say if you want to try `magit`, just type M-x
el-get-install, then `magit`. El-get will download it and install it
so you can starting using it in your git projects. Once you can find
your way around Emacs, you can start your journey of how best
organize your config/customization as you go along. I use just one
org file for it and you might or might not like it. Here is the file
in its entirety if you are interested: <a href="./static/config.html">My config snapshot</a>

<p>
After taking some time off from work to focus on projects that I like
to take on, I set out to find a simple way to use git and emacs workflow to
start blogging again. Among plethora of options on the web, I came
across this project - <a href="https://github.com/bastibe/org-static-blog">Org Static Blog</a> - that I resonated with. It took
me no time to set it up and start blogging. Below is my setup:
