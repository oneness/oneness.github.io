  <p>  I enjoy engineering information systems optimized for end user and
  developer productivity, which can only be achieved by being vigilant
  about keeping IT as simple as IT possibly can be. If you are into
  Clojure, F# or other Programming Languages that I should check
  out, drop me a line via ktuman at acm dot org.

<p>
I have been building systems in Clojure/ClojureScript for the the last
7 years or so. I enjoy using it to solve day to day problems. It is
still my go-to language of choice and I love the fact that it guides me
to think about problem at hand with very data centric way. As a tiny
example of this, consider a feature where you need to toggle the sort
ordering:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-clojure"><span style="color: #7f7f7f;">(</span><span style="color: #a020f0;">defn</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">toggle-order</span> <span style="color: #7f7f7f;">[</span>order<span style="color: #7f7f7f;">]</span>
  <span style="color: #7f7f7f;">(</span>order {<span style="color: #008b8b;">:asc</span> <span style="color: #008b8b;">:desc</span>
          <span style="color: #008b8b;">:desc</span> <span style="color: #008b8b;">:asc</span>}<span style="color: #7f7f7f;">))</span>
</pre>

It is tiny but mighty. There is no if/else/case etc and it is easy to
read, which is extremely important as your program grows due to needed
complexity. Speaking of being <b>easy to read</b>, I could not help but to
quote following from SICP book:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Our design of this introductory computer-science subject reï¬‚ects two
major concerns. First, we want to establish the idea that a computer
language is not just a way of gettng a computer to perform operations
but rather that it is a novel formal medium for expressing ideas about
methodology. <b>Thus, programs must be written for people to read, and
only incidentally for machines to execute.</b> Second, we believe that
the essential material to be addressed by a subject at this level is
not the syntax of particular programming-language constructs, nor
clever algorithms for computing particular functions efficiently, nor
even the mathematical analysis of algorithms and the foundations of
computing, but rather the techniques used to control the intellectual
complexity of large software systems.
</p>
</blockquote>

For me, Using Clojure and Datomic professionally has been a game
changer not only in terms of being more problem solving focused but
more importantly a paradigm shift for taming domain complexity. It has
helped me deliver robust, high performance systems within time and
budget. However, having bitten by half baked distributed systems made
up of tiny services done as afterthoughts, I have always been on the
lookout for more robust distributed system development story. Then I
found <b>Elixir</b>, a functional language running on Erlang VM called
<b>BEAM</b>. After spending some time attending ElixirConf US and couple of
meetups in <b>ErlangElixirSF</b>, I am posting what I really liked about
Elixir community that Clojure Community might benefit:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Elixir community has a strong focus on few important projects in
their ecosystem, namely <b>Elixir the language and its build tool-
Mix</b>, <b>Pheonix Framework</b>, <b>Nerve</b>, <b>Ecto</b>, and <b>absinthe - The
GraphQL toolkit for Elixir</b>.</li>
<li>Elixir community is pretty mature in terms of keeping the core
language small and extensible, which is abundantly clear from the
creator of Elixir, Jose Valim&rsquo;s 2018 ElixirConf US keynote.</li>
<li>Elixir community is super focused on Documentation and Developer
happiness by having great tooling and convention that they all love
and agreed upon such as <b>mix format</b></li>
</ul>

<p>
I hope someone from both community find above helpful.
