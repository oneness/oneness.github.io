<p>
I have been a happy user of <b><a href="https://voidlinux.org/">VoidLinux</a></b> for about a year now and so
far have had almost no glitches whatsoever except for updating a year
old version of it installed on one of my spare laptop. The issue started as following:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-shell">xbps-install -Su
# resulted in following:
# mozjs: broken, unresolvable shlib `libicu.so'
# Transaction aborted due to unresolved shlibs.
</pre>
</div>
<p>
I do not now about you but I usually start with a google search of
what I think is somewhat general terms in my error message, which is
<i><b>"Transaction aborted due to unresolved shlibs"</b></i> in my case. Searching
with the above term came up with number of results and all point to
the build system is still running. You can check the status of it
here: <a href="https://build.voidlinux.eu/waterfall">Void Build Status</a>, which I did find that all is green and
idle. So it did not help me resolve my issue. Then, I decided to do
one more search with <i><b>"mozjs: broken, unresolvable shlib
`libicu.so'"</b></i>, which is more specific to the state of my box only but
that did not help me go anywhere. Then I decided to debug it
myself. Following is my commandline session how I resolved it:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-shell"># Ran the command again to make sure I have above issue 
xbps-install -Su
# again resulted in following:
# mozjs: broken, unresolvable shlib `libicu.so'
# Transaction aborted due to unresolved shlibs.
# Notice the /*mozjs*/, which is my clue. Then I did:
xbps-query -Rs mozjs
# from the output, I confirmed that it was not installed on my box,
# which is my second clue to check if my repos url are
# up-to-date. Remember it is a year old version of VoidLinux.  I
# noticed from the output of xpbs-install -u, that the
# void-repo-nonfree url does indeed point to an old url. So, I did:
xbps-remove void-repo-nonfree &amp;&amp; xbps-install void-repo-nonfree
# to make sure my repo url is up-to-date. Then it is time to clean my
# repo cache and remove any packages that might be orphened since my
# repo url is pointing to a different url now. Using manpages for
# xpbs-remove, I can do above with:
xbps-remove -Oo
# Then I ran:
xbps-install -Su
# Voila!, My one year old box is up-to-date without any issues now.
# After all of this, I just made an one liner alias in my shell config:
alias c='xbps-remove void-repo-nonfree &amp;&amp; xbps-install void-repo-nonfree &amp;&amp; xbps-install -Su 
</pre>
</div>

<p>
So no love lost for VoidLinux and it is still as awesome as ever. Just
to recap steps that I took to solve the issue:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Start using more general term to do a google search then narrow it
to specific ones. If it works, you save time and unneeded effort.</li>
<li>Check for the problem package reported. Is it installed? If yes,
try removing or updating it to see if it resolves your issue.</li>
<li>If you do not see the package installed, it might be repo url +
orphaned package issue. So update the repo url, remove orphan
packages and rebuild the cache.</li>
</ol>

<p>
If you tried all of the above and your issue still did not get
resolved, you might want to post it in VoidLinux forum for help.
