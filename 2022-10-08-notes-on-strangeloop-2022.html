<p>
StrangeLoop this year made me feel almost as normal as those during
pre pandemic times especially in terms of size of participants and
sponsors. I actually believe it had the most sponsorship so far among
those I attended over the years. One noticeable company was AWS that a
friend of mine joined earlier this year. So it was pretty exciting to
meet up with him there. As always, the breadths of folks and topics
from all walks of Software Engineering is just excellent this time as
well. I took few notes on the talks that I am able to attend and would
summarize them on few categories below.
</p>

<p>
<b>Dev Experience</b> : I consider observability to be an important part of
 development experience, which is always pushed back as an
 afterthought for almost all the startups that I worked with and I
 know of. The talk "Building Observability for 99% Developers" by Jean
 Yang just resonated with me and I am really glad that her company is
 building tools to make developer experience better using <a href="https://ebpf.io">eBPF</a> that
 has matured in the last few years. It was quite and entertaining talk
 and I highly recommend you check it out. Another talk that I really
 enjoyed is "Workflows, a new abstraction for distributed systems" by
 Dominik Tornow. If you are dealing with the chaos of distributed
 services, the abstraction that he presented make you feel like you
 are working with monolith (oh the happy times :) again with the
 advantage of cloud scalibility.
</p>

<p>
<b>Programming Languages</b> : I personally prefer dynamic languages
 (Clojure to be exact) as my tools of choice for my day to day
 practice of solving problems for people but I do see the benefit of
 type system as a guiding rail when designing an API or better yet
 generating code. You should check out the talk "Codegen with Types,
 for Humans, by Humans" by Matthew Griffith, where he talks about how
 to use types to generate code for human consumption. If you are
 working with (or say fighting with) type system that is complecting
 your business logic/code execution, you should check out the talk
 "Monad I Love You Now Get Out Of My Type System" by Gjeta Gjyshinca,
 where she talks about the platform that helps Scala developer to get
 their type system out of business logic with just five extra
 characters, @node, with a compiler plugin.
</p>

<p>
<b>Data Centric Problem Solving</b> : Strange Loop Conf have always been
 attractive to data centric practices and paradigms and this year was
 no different. There are many talks related to how to generate,
 architect and analyze data. The talk titled "Data-driven
 investigation in defense of human rights" by Christo Buschek is
 presented with very clear and methodical approaches to solve real
 problems we face around the world. I really feel like we need more of
 that type of work where we put technology for the benefit of our
 fellow human beings. I think he should do another presentation next
 year titled "Data-driven investigation in defense of peace and
 opposition of war", which surely makes me sign up for Strange Loop
 for one last time (Next year will be the last time you can experience
 Strange Loop and I highly recommend you attend to see what you have
 been missing).
