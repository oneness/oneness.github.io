One of the feature of Eshell that took me sometime to really
appreciate is its built-in ability to emulate Plan9 smart Shell. It
allows you to run a script or a command, run it again by just hitting
enter key after you modify it, say you made a mistake or want to
change part of it using Emacs editing power. You might say that you
can do same thing in any terminal using your up arrow key and command
line editing. But I challenge you to try it until you fully realize
the advantage you have vs regular terminal. Below is a simple screen
recording to show you what I mean:

I recommend you read following post to learn more about smart shell
and more about eshell including aliases:

This concludes my `Why Eshell` series. Hope you find it useful and
happy Eshelling!
