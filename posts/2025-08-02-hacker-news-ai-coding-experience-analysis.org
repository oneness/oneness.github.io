I have been using and experimenting with AI coding tools heavily for
the last 3 months or so since joining [[https://www.legionhealth.com/][Legion Health]] as a Founding
Engineer. I was somewhat skeptical and approached using AI with
suspicion since ChatGPT came out. I use Emacs as my workbench and
optimized my workflow around using it as a terminal multiplexer, which
naturally fits with Claude Code that I use as my main programming
assistant. Below is my simple setup that might benefit other fellow
minimalist Emacs users.
#+begin_src elisp
  (use-package eat :ensure t :config
    (setq eat-term-name "xterm-256color" eat-kill-buffer-on-exit t
          process-adaptive-read-buffering nil eat-term-scrollback-size 500000)
    (define-key eat-semi-char-mode-map [?\s-v] #'eat-yank)
    (define-key eat-semi-char-mode-map [?\C-c ?\C-r] #'k/eat-redisplay))
  (defun k/eat-redisplay ()
  "Fix eat flicker/flash and display funkiness"
  (interactive)
  (unless (derived-mode-p 'eat-mode)
    (error "Not in an eat-mode buffer"))
  (when (and (boundp 'eat-mode) eat-mode (boundp 'eat-terminal) eat-terminal)
    (let* ((process (eat-term-parameter eat-terminal 'eat--process))
           (window (get-buffer-window (current-buffer))))
      (if (and process (process-live-p process) window)
          (eat--adjust-process-window-size process (list window)))))
  (setq-local window-adjust-process-window-size-function
              'window-adjust-process-window-size-smallest)
  (goto-char (point-min))
  (redisplay)
  (goto-char (point-max))
  (redisplay)
  (setq-local window-adjust-process-window-size-function 'ignore))
#+end_src

I start an eat shell and run:
#+begin_src bash
  cd ~/repos/project-x && claude
#+end_src

This is a fast moving landscape and I find following few points are
extremely helpful in my workflow:
- Spend few minutes to gather up and feed context related to what needs to be
  done to Claude at the start of a session.
- Always ask to show a plan and instruct Claude for guidance if there
  multiple options for a solution.
- Provide a skeleton such as directory structure, file names, function names
  and signatures.
- Provide use case and acceptance criteria testing instructions.

On top of that, you need to make sure Claude has access to tools that
enhances its ability to look up relevant information. To provide more
balanced overview of the AI coding experience, I used a great data
analysis tool for Hacker News called [[https://camelai.com/][CamelAI]]. Below are the result
that more or less resonates with my personal experience.

* 📊 Key Trends & Patterns
  - 🎯 Claude Dominance in AI Coding
    + Evidence: Claude 3.7 Sonnet (2,127 pts), consistent praise in experience stories
    + Insight: Anthropic's Claude has emerged as the clear leader for serious coding work, with developers consistently praising its code quality and reasoning capabilities over competitors
  - ⚡ Tool Fragmentation & User Frustration
    + Evidence: Cursor problems (1,511 pts), multiple "stopped using AI" stories (365, 109 pts)
    + Insight: Users are jumping between tools due to policy changes, reliability issues, and unmet expectations. No single tool has achieved universal satisfaction, leading to "tool fatigue"
  - 🔄 The Productivity Paradox
    + Evidence: "Anyone struggling to get value out of coding LLMs?" (345 pts), productivity studies showing mixed results
    + Insight: Despite massive hype, many developers struggle to see concrete productivity gains. The "almost right" code problem creates hidden productivity taxes that offset benefits
  - 🧠 Cognitive Dependency Concerns
    + Evidence: "After months of coding with LLMs, I'm going back to using my brain" (365 pts)
    + Insight: Growing concern about over-reliance on AI leading to skill atrophy and reduced problem-solving capabilities among developers
  - 🏢 Enterprise vs Individual Experience Gap
    + Evidence: Microsoft 365 Copilot disaster (602 pts) vs individual success stories
    + Insight: Stark divide between enterprise rollout failures and individual developer successes. Enterprise context adds complexity that current tools struggle with
  - 🔓 Open Source Alternative Movement
    + Evidence: Void alternative (948 pts), Tabby self-hosted (366 pts)
    + Insight: Strong demand for open-source, self-hosted alternatives driven by privacy concerns, cost considerations, and desire for control
* 🎯 Engineer Experience Patterns
  - 🟢 Positive Experiences
    + Who: Experienced developers using AI as an enhancement tool
    + Patterns: Claude-based tools getting consistent praise, terminal-based tools popular with power users
    + Benefits: Code generation, debugging assistance, learning new patterns
    + Key Success Factor: Using AI to amplify existing skills, not replace them
  - 🔴 Negative Experiences
    + Who: Beginners over-relying on AI, enterprise users with complex requirements
    + Patterns: Policy changes causing churn, productivity promises not materializing, "almost right" code creating more work
    + Problems: Skill degradation, tool reliability issues, hidden productivity costs
    + Key Failure Factor: Expecting AI to replace fundamental programming knowledge
  - 🟡 Mixed Experiences
    + Who: Pragmatic developers experimenting with different approaches
    + Patterns: Tools working well for specific use cases, steeper learning curve than expected, context-dependent effectiveness
    + Insight: Success heavily depends on matching use case, experience level, and realistic expectations
* 📈 Temporal Evolution (2024-2025)
  - Early 2024: Initial hype phase - GitHub Copilot going free, new tool launches
  - Mid 2024: Reality check phase - limitations becoming apparent, user frustrations mounting
  - Late 2024: Maturation phase - Claude emerges as leader, tool fragmentation increases
  - Early 2025: Sophistication phase - Claude 3.7/Code dominance, better understanding of limitations
  - Mid 2025: Pragmatic phase - Focus on specific use cases, open-source alternatives, realistic expectations
* 🎯 Critical Insights for Engineers
  - 💪 Skill Foundation is Critical
    + AI tools amplify existing programming skills rather than replace them. Developers who understand fundamentals see the most benefit.
  - 🎯 Context Matters Enormously
    + Success depends heavily on use case, project complexity, and domain. There's no universal "AI coding works" or "doesn't work."
  - 🔧 Tool Landscape is Rapidly Changing
    + Claude-based tools currently leading, but the landscape shifts quickly. Expect to try multiple approaches.
  - ⚠️ Cognitive Risks are Real
    + Over-reliance can lead to skill degradation. Many successful developers use AI selectively while maintaining core problem-solving abilities.
  - 📊 Productivity Benefits are Mixed
    + Benefits exist but are often not as dramatic as promised. The "almost right" problem creates hidden costs that offset gains.
  - 🏢 Enterprise Success ≠ Individual Success
    + Individual developer success doesn't guarantee organizational success. Enterprise complexity creates additional challenges.
* 🔮 Future Outlook
  - 🎯 Specialization: Tools becoming more domain-specific and context-aware
  - 🤝 Hybrid Workflows: Combination of AI assistance and traditional coding becoming the norm
  - 🔬 Better Metrics: More sophisticated ways to measure actual productivity impact
  - 🎓 Education Evolution: Teaching AI-assisted development as a core skill
  - 🔓 Democratization: More open-source and self-hosted options emerging
  - 🎛️ UI Innovation: Moving beyond copilots to more integrated experiences (AI HUDs)
* 🔍 Specific Tool Performance
  - 🥇 Claude: Clear winner for code quality, reasoning, and complex tasks
  - 🥈 Cursor: Popular but plagued by policy and reliability issues
  - 🥉 GitHub Copilot: Solid mainstream choice, good accessibility for beginners
  - 🔓 Open Source (Void/Tabby): Rising alternatives for privacy/control-conscious developers
  - ⚠️ Enterprise Tools: Microsoft 365 Copilot struggled badly in enterprise rollouts
* 💡 Bottom Line
  - The AI coding experience is highly polarized - it works exceptionally well for some developers in specific contexts, but fails to deliver promised productivity gains for many others. Success requires:
    + Matching the right tool to the right use case
    + Maintaining realistic expectations
    + Preserving core programming skills
    + Understanding tool limitations
    + Being prepared to adapt as the landscape evolves
