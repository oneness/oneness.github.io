While back when I was learning Clojure, I have written a small lib
that allows me directly generate bar chart out of google search
results from Clojure. I updated it with latest deps and added a fn to
save the bar-chart to a png file. You can checkout the project here:
[[https://github.com/oneness/gcount][https://github.com/oneness/gcount]].  Here is a one liner to get you
going:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
git clone git@github.com:oneness/gcount.git && cd gcount && lein repl
#+END_SRC
Once you are in repl, you can type following:
#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(search-view-terms ["Clojure Programming" "Elixir Programming" "Elm Programming"])
#+END_SRC
Above will produce something like this:
