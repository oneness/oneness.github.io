#+title: VM flags from running JVM

While I was doing some JVM GC analysis recently, I got curious about the vm flags that `java` command uses by default if you do not specify it when starting your JVM.
Reading up JDK docs, I found *jcmd* is exactly what you need:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
jcmd
#+END_SRC
That will list all jvm instances running on your system beginning with
its pids, which you can pass into *jcmd* with options to print VM flags like this:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
jcmd <pid> VM.flags
#+END_SRC
There are many options you can use other than `VM.flags`, which you can get a full list by:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
jcmd <pid> help
#+END_SRC
