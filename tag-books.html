<p>
I am pretty excited to learn that Strange Loop is happening this
year! It is one of the few technical conference that I always
recommend to my fellow teammates. What is more exciting are the
sessions including few keynotes. What this has to do with the
topic of the blog post, which is on programming style, you say? If you
squint at the sessions, the author of <b>Exercises in Programming Style</b>
is the first keynote speaker. It is one of the best book on programming I
have ever read in recent years. I am not going to spoil it here with
summary or gist but I'd like share few take home points I really liked
about the book.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Having a clear, well understood programming problem throughout the
book: given a text file, we want to display the N (e.g. 25) most
frequent words and corresponding frequencies ordered by decreasing
value of frequency. Once the understanding what problem we are
dealing with out of the way, the remaining is just choosing a style
to solve it, which the book does fantastic job to explain. It even
has full source code in the book.</li>
<li>Concise and clear way of making the reader understand many programming
techniques that one might otherwise gets really confused. For
example, Monads, CPS (continuation passing style), FRP and many
others.</li>
<li>Have you ever wondered how neural networks (NN) works? Second
edition have you covered with clear explanation and code as she has
done with many concepts from the first edition.</li>
</ul>

<p>
I strongly recommend the book to both novice or pros alike. It is a
book that you rarely see in terms of style and clarity with full
working code. We really need this kind of books more to have
programming accessible and understood by more people. I do believe it
is a classic. If you are planning to attend Strange Loop, remember to
say hello and thank her for it.
